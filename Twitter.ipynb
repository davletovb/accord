In the best case scenario all the companies that burnt trust in a burst of censorious madness find they can only regain it by going crypto on everything. Decentralized cryptographic verification of information supply chain starting with Verizon? ? It’s brinkmanship. It kills trust in their institution. It’s the waiter openly spitting on the ground right next to your table. The whole value prop of an immutable archive is we will not edit . This is why chain of custody is a thing. Because motivated tampering is a thing. You have an untouched archive and provide commentary offsite. There are literally millions of commentary feeds to add color and only a few archival sites. Sad they decided to destroy trust in their institution. Without cryptographic validation you can no longer trust the site. In both cases the entire value proposition is about trust. Trust that it wasn’t maliciously tampered with. The fact that the has publicly signaled that they CAN edit the archives means trust in their stewardship has evaporated. Fortunately we have crypto.

Note deleted amp reposted two tweets in this thread because included slightly wrong link. The Coder Stories link is the right one. Take a look at the screenshots below to see an alternative vision of what tech writing might look like. Informative amp fun One thing that jumps out at me from those pieces social media isn’t the only factor in reducing the quality of tech writing. Once technology became the tech industry amp worth billions many people got into it just for money. Coverage gradually dumbed down to focus on funding. This whole series of articles is some of the best tech journalism I’ve ever seen. Because it’s not all gossip columns and funding rounds. The reader actually learns something. It’s like but for tech. Great work by on this interview. Really illustrates some key concepts including a that technically literate people should be writing amp reporting on tech b there’s plenty of talent out there internationally we haven’t tapped and c we can do so much better. Want a totally fresh take on tech journalism? Behold an interviewer who knows enough about DNS to conduct an informative interview with the inventor of DNS. Here’s a tutorial on setting up hosted Ghost at your own domain. You can switch over to self hosted Ghost when ready. Wordpress also works in a similar way you can start hosted and move to self hosted. Substack is excellent and keeps improving. But if you want a polished open source alternative where you can self host everything that’s . It’s never been more important to ask the question can it scale? Who could have predicted that censorship would censor the censor calling for censorship? The core of science is independent replication not peer review. But we don’t have wind tunnels or inclined planes at home. We can’t easily replicate scientific experiments. Or can we? We do have devices capable of doing billions of computations. We can at least check the math. Put another way we have millions of independent replications and billions of devices that give experimental confirmation of Maxwell’s equations. That’s science. And that’s very different from some just published data analysis. That’s not science it’s a provisional result. The abuse of science in the name of science was particularly egregious this year. What it boils down to is stealing the prestige of Maxwell’s equations for some shaky data analysis. The level of independent replication differs by orders of magnitude. Very abstract discussion. The employer knows their unit economics. They have local knowledge. They can see if a minimum wage hike will put their business underwater. Perhaps there is global benefit doubtful but relatively few entities have the microeconomic data to show that. How do you deal with times when the network completely drops? Use local autonomy and just pull over? Or something else? Bitcoin has been a store of value and medium of exchange for some time but it’s also become a unit of account. Every investment in the cryptoeconomy is benchmarked against BTC. Because property is defended with encryption not violence. How world leaders meet 1910 kings wearing royal attire in a castle 2000 politicians wearing suits and ties at Davos 2020 CEOs wearing hoodies and flip flops on a Zoom call There may be a restricted subset of English that is more translation friendly. The new spell check is translation check? More people in the crypto community should be aware of this. Because it’s possible to have property rights and smart contracts enforced by the network rather than any one entity. This may result in more competitive markets long term and less vulnerability to centralized states and corporations alike. I actually very much disagree with Zeihan on most things other than fracking’s geopolitical importance . Longer critique here in this podcast. Maybe worth an essay. Crypto Capital is the hope of the rest of the world. It is stateless capitalism it is capitalism without corporations it is decentralized censorship resistance and it is principled non violence. And it is the youngest but may yet prove the strongest. Woke Capital is the ideology of much of modern America. It’s capitalism that enables decentralized censorship cancel culture and American empire. It’s drone strike democracy. Communist Capital is the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party. It’s capitalism checked by the centralized power of the Chinese state as pithily summarized here. Each represents a left right fusion that’s bizarre by the standards of the 1980s consensus. It’s PRC vs MMT vs BTC. The future is Communist Capital vs Woke Capital vs Crypto Capital. Another angle Twitter search is distinct from Google search in that it’s harder to invisibly censor. That’s because Google’s rankings shift constantly in a non transparent way but it’s very obvious when a Twitter user is banned. A search canary kind of like a warrant canary. Here’s the serious version. Build global companies. Use decentralized technologies. And hire from the 96 of the world that is not American and the large percentage of Americans that aren’t obsessed with US politics. Remember the New York Times Company announced it is becoming a tech company. That means it has gotten in the ring. This is not some public trust it’s a 7B firm aiming for 70B. Coke doesn’t help Pepsi. Google doesn’t aid FB. Why should you give free content to a competitor? Build your own media arm. Don’t respond to employees of legacy media corps. Whatever you have to say say it in your own words. Better yet say it in your own film. Just don’t consent to giving them free content. Bezos Sulzberger and Murdoch already have enough money. The new vanity metric is vanity media. You simply do not need legacy media coverage to reach an audience. It’s junk traffic. You no longer need to pay a toll to a media middleman to reach an audience. You don’t need them at all. The internet destroyed one of the media’s most important sources of power being the only place that could offer access to an audience. Media corporations are slowly realizing that leverage has shifted. You don’t need to give free content to Bezos Sulzberger or Murdoch employees to get the word out anymore. Just build your own audience and go direct if you have something to say. BTC and ETH may each handle close to a trillion dollars of volume this year. People outside the space simply do not understand the scale of the cryptoeconomy. A key reason this is feasible ride sharing interfaces haven’t changed in years. That means you can freeze the frontend and decentralize the backend. Of course the protocol version of Uber would be more complex just like Bitcoin was more complex than PayPal. But it would win. So what eventually happens is that all these platforms get turned into crypto protocols. Every rider and driver now share in the upside. And due to encryption voluntary transactions between two parties can no longer be surveilled and interdicted by the state. I’m very sympathetic to and ’s points about making sure workers share upside. Had Uber been able to give equity to all 1M drivers perhaps they’d be a 100B company with 50B owned by drivers at 50k driver. A happier and economically aligned workforce. Absolutely agree that workers should share in the upside of these platforms. But a state that fails at basic functions like police fire public health education sanitation isn’t capable of competent regulation. That’s why AB5 was a disaster. There is a better way though On chain or it didn’t happen. While just for fun today putting data on chain will replace formal marriage registries in 10 20 years. Deprecate the state replace it with the network. Ledger of record gt paper of record Forget NYT Vows. Record your indissoluble bond on the immutable blockchain. Remember also that early operating systems and browsers operated in highly resource constrained environments. Programs needed to be optimized to the kilobyte or sometimes the byte. We're still in that era in crypto. But extrapolate out five ten fifteen twenty years Those are absolutely up there too. You can argue that Unreal and Unity are basically operating systems in that they are targets for virtual worlds. Eventually I think these all converge into VR AR based operating systems with virtual currencies that can be accessed via web URLs. We already knew how crypto enables competition with Facebook amp Twitter. Crypto social networks improve monetization identity hosting etc. But the OS lens gives a long term roadmap for competing with parts of Google Apple MS. Use a blockchain to go after the OS and browser. One consequence of this line of thinking the era of operating system innovation may be about to begin again. It's been Linux Mac Windows for generations. But modern blockchains have UXs block explorers communities interoperability novel applications and monetization. A web browser is after all essentially an OS. It has an interpreter you write apps for it and so on. ChromeOS took this to its natural conclusion. A blockchain is also an OS. It has a compiler you write apps for it and so on. What will take this to its natural conclusion? These reflect the on disk online and on chain eras respectively. From desktop to internet to crypto. The three most complex pieces of software are operating systems web browsers and blockchains. If you can use an algorithm to determine whether the content is near the policy line then you can reduce the reach of the post. Importantly because these algorithms would run upon a blockchain or similar decentralized datastore they would not just be open source. They'd be open state and open execution. A glass box where you can see every database entry amp replay every opcode. In this model all community members would consciously opt in to a crypto social network with a transparent backend governance model and social contract. Content standards would be arrived upon by a community with enforcement by transparent algorithms. An alternative approach that is becoming more feasible is open state backend like a blockchain community imposed content standards transparent algorithmic enforcement pseudonymous crypto governance A crypto social network for each community. Of course the problem with ML based pre publication content review by FB Twitter is that these are for profit American companies put in the role of soft censoring millions. I think many people there have good intent but as folks have noted the potential for abuse is obvious. Right now the policy line is determined by community reaction or manual platform review. So there are humans in the loop. However if FB or Twitter's databases were open source anyone could try ML to try predicting virality amp sentiment for a post. Probably some signal there. A fundamental issue is that viral content tends to be provocative. In theory it's possible to change the incentive structure as shown by these two graphs. Great metaphor for Twitter. In context of course it's meant to be a joke. But also has some validity in that one may be assessing along the wrong dimensions. Changing just the Y axis will get you a higher fraction of blues higher standards but altering your coordinate system will get you 100 blue. From a machine learning perspective standards that are too high result in false negatives. Standards that are too low result in false positives. But better algorithms can reduce both false positives and false negatives. gt founders aren't going to be able to build a meaningful audience First many founders tweeting in their spare time have built larger followings than entire newspapers. Second failing to build an audience in 2020 is like failing to build a website. It’s a necessary task. Write your own software. Create your own media. Right. You can’t just add PR sauce to an uninteresting product and get people interested. Good article. I think it’s more like war war war peace though. Takes a long time before a company can really just coast and afford to make mistakes. If you are selling nonsense as a service PR won’t help. Selling non nonsense may. After that you still need to get the word out somehow. But rather than doing so indirectly via legacy media corporations you go direct through your own media arm. Btw many PR people will adapt or already have. was one of the first to do first party original content for tech and helped build the a16z podcast into a real source of tech news. I think we’ll see much more of that. Editors in chief not VP Comms. Be the media. Editor in chief will become a C level position at many tech companies over the 2020s. On par with CTO or COO. It’s a more descriptive title than VP of Communications. Because it signifies that tech is building its own full stack media arms. Yes. The partnerships that work tend to be simple distribution deals. The partnerships that don’t tend to be boondoggles where no one can articulate how the money is made let alone how it is split. Sales is hard but much more straightforward by comparison. Not saying I doubt but this would be a great retrospective analysis. For each historical election you have the predicted winner and probability of winning from both 538 and a given prediction market. And the actual winner. Tabulate that data and make graphs. Present company excepted of course. But there were thousands of articles that were confident condescending and wrong. When it comes to misinformation on COVID 19 unfortunately the legacy press and the state both completely failed. Remember Don’t Worry About Coronavirus Worry About the Flu and No Handshakes Please and Stop Wearing Masks ? No retractions no resignations no trust. One way to bootstrap your new company’s media arm is to start with a founding influencer or recruit one early on. Then grow this into something more professional over time. I have no beef with Electrek and think you do some good work. But Electrek like any media company is just a corporation. Another corporation has the right and nowadays the obligation to build its own media arm. You may write positive and negative stories about each other. Point being that the concept of the press as a entity distinct from the citizenry at large is going away. Every citizen a citizen journalist. And just as NYT is becoming a tech company tech firms are building media arms. Every company a media company. Typist used to be a profession. Now everyone types. And everyone writes. And publishes to the internet. And has a YouTube and podcast and so on. Often with larger followings than the professionals. And the professionals likewise are going to Substack. So we are all equal now. Limited space in one tweet. But I suggest that this is the new model build your own domain specific in house media arm. After all Comcast owns NBC Bezos owns the Post etc. Media companies are just corporations at the end of the day. Decentralize your PR. Rather than spending 100k on the next PR person why not give ten 10k fellowships to up and coming influencers around the world who’ve demonstrated interest in your area? Like Nike sponsoring athletes sponsor creators with proven talent in your field. The old model of PR was propitiating legacy media corporations. The new model is to build your own serious media arm. Learn to code. Then learn to write report publish direct. Start with a blog graduate to a YouTube TV channel. Or something like Stripe Press. Be creative. As every company becomes a media company every citizen becomes a citizen journalist. Want a quote from ? Check his feed like everyone else. Everyone gets access to the same info at the same time. The whole concept of giving free content quotes interviews to legacy media corporations is obsolete. It’s a habit. A bad habit. Break it. And if you have news to break break it on your own channels your Twitter YouTube podcast or blog. Don’t have a channel? Build one. Every company is now a media company. Go direct if you have something to say. Ideally ubiquitous translation leads to greater understanding between countries. But maybe it just means the entire world is engulfed in one endless social flamewar even more than today. Or conversely that people overseas have a much larger voice in US events. Or all three Machine translation will eventually be ubiquitous. Real time translation of everything you say hear read and write. This is one of those predictable events with unpredictable consequences. More than 95 of the world is not American. Worth keeping in mind. This woke is feeling particularly bold today calling a thot . That’s not acceptable behavior and he probably needs to hear that. It’s always the wokest whites who want to silence immigrants women and people of color. This is what I had in mind. I drew a separate set of triangles though. Good idea to set one length to 1 to simplify the algebra. Yes. Way more people are willing to invest capital than reputational capital. It is interesting how few figures there tend to be in some of the Springer texts. Often you can summarize a whole chapter with a good figure. Right. But that’s like defining a random variable in terms of sigma algebras and Borel sets. It makes sense after you’ve built intuition with elementary derivations. You may be right. They have a recommendation engine where you can give it more examples and it generates more logos like the one you selected so that was my presumption. But under the hood it could well be eg just a deterministic algorithm with a pseudorandom seed. Yeah that’s the one I was thinking of. With some inscribed triangles. It’s a bit of a pain to set up but you can get there with just definitions of cosine and sine similar triangles and some algebra. Yeah. But what’s the pre calc derivation? To get Euler’s formula you need limits power series imaginary numbers other pieces of machinery. Eg I’m not sure if you could get to the derivative of cos x without the cos A B formula which means you can’t get the power series. It’s sometimes fun to rederive the basic stuff. Can you get the formula for cos A B from scratch without looking it up? Try . Pretty decent AI based fast logo builder. The alternative is that kind of debate every day in every Slack channel. Enough. Starkware has a great writeup of their entry in the recent scaling bake off here This may produce a radical reduction in Ethereum gas costs. Cavalry is coming. How do we replace argument from authority with argument from cryptography? Here is a sketch of some of the mathematical ideas. The present of journalism is Brooklyn's wokest. The future is decentralized cryptographic truth. This NYT journalist spends more energy attacking tiny American startups than investigating giant Chinese conglomerates. Why? Because she has 500k followers on TikTok and someone criticized her on Clubhouse once. The Interchain We’re still in the pre Oauth era of crypto. Chains as domains is a useful concept as they are decentralized hosts of code and data. But interchain routing is non systematic right now. We need a general way to address remote code on one chain from another chain. Cities may not be able to financially endure this. Many were already in a parlous state prior to COVID. We may see a wave of municipal bankruptcies. To prevent this or at least reduce the impact it’s important that discussion happens in some neutral forum. Not Weibo Chinese or Twitter American . May have to be something genuinely censorship resistant perhaps even pseudonymous. See also this thread A crypto Cyanogen is probably possible in 2020. An open source Android fork built to accommodate crypto. Similar to what Brave did with Chrome. Make a crypto wallet as core to the offering as the browser. And build everything around that. What’s also clear is that Armstrong believes he’s far from alone among his C Suite peers not just at Coinbase or in the crypto industry but among executive teams across corporate America And Armstrong is probably right to think so. I do agree with you that the coverage of the situation in China was sober. But there was an arrogant tone to the domestic coverage an assumption that it couldn't happen in America. This led to the country being completely unprepared. Evelyn that's simply not the case. WaPo NYT Opinion BuzzFeed Wired CNN and many more downplayed it for weeks. Recode infamously put the virus is contained in their no handshakes piece. Infographic below has some clips. See also thread. gt there were several news sources reporting on covid in January Oh they were reporting on it. But they were saying it wasn’t going to be a problem in the US. Here’s a sample thread from Jan 30. Computational analysis of literature. In this groundbreaking book Franco Moretti argues that literature scholars should stop reading books and start counting graphing and mapping them instead. Online is easier though. Offline world has built in delays and lags and so on. So it will start with digital professions Wow amazing cite. Moretti’s work looks awesome. I check in on it every few years here's what I saw a while ago One interesting concept is to prove you still have this skill clear this level again. All the cost of a college education includes zero budget for lifelong maintenance. Incorporating 's finding on mnemonic media could be very helpful. I think a fundamental difference is that it's interactive and hence bidirectional. You couldn't do this with broadcast television. Related to 's excellent essay here I've been looking at the gamification of early childhood education. Some apps like Tynker are really quite good. It seems obvious that this trend will eventually transform what we now know of as high school collegiate and even professional education. This joke is at least twenty years old but still good. Obviously if you actually cared about the correctness of the articles that appear on your site you'd take pains to downrank any outlets that didn't run retractions for immensely consequential falsehoods. But I don't want to distract from your real job of chasing clicks Somehow those tech journalists styled themselves experts in public health remember? Get a single retraction from these people. What they did was shameful. Gabe you did a phenomenal job getting the news out no wait you didn't and neither did your friends. Please get them to retract. No handshakes please A crypto exchange is like a massively multiplayer online video game where you can win or lose in real life. I’m actually surprised that no one has developed game interfaces for running a business yet. Trading on crypto exchanges already feels like this. To some extent so does Twitter for media. Metrics dashboards and GPT 3 NPC chatbots might allow you to push this concept further. You got it. Now think about how big the trust problem is in other areas. And if you can replace or reduce the need for trust with computation that allows us to build high trust layers on top of a low trust internet. basically trust but verify gt trust if verified Noah asks a key question who but China can step into the gap as the US turns inward? The counterintuitive answer may be new entities born from the internet. After all crypto offers governance primitives tech produces competent leaders and the internet is international… This is an interesting discussion between and on US China relations. It's more substantive than most Twitter repartee and gives a good snapshot of the Chinese nationalist and fast disappearing American internationalist views.  9 It spreads the wealth more broadly than tech which itself was a major innovation in terms of giving stock options to employees. Crypto gt equity gt salary in terms of the ability to align more people towards a common goal. 8 It’s also a wholly new way to develop and monetize apps. As different from the cloud as cloud was from desktop. With similar consequences for incumbents. on disk online on chain zero servers centralized servers decentralized servers 7 It’s the best of the West transparency technical excellence rule of law equality of opportunity yet set up in such a way that anyone who subscribes to those values can be part of it. From imperfect proposition nations to engineered proposition currencies. 6 It is truly international capitalism and steps into the vacuum as America descends into nationalist socialism. As such it’s what wins in the long run. Americans and Chinese don’t respect each others’ governments or currencies but millions on both sides do hold Bitcoin. 5 It is far more risk tolerant and genuinely rebellious than what SV has become over the last ten years note though that SV is still an improvement over the legacy paradigm of getting an MBA. Far better to get a CEO degree. 4 It is an alternative to many legacy institutions Wall Street decentralized finance Silicon Valley decentralized protocols Yale Law smart contracts Columbia Journalism crypto oracles Federal Reserve algorithmic monetary policy Harvard KSG on chain governance Some of the reasons why 1 It has much more philosophical depth than tech. Can’t understand BTC without history 2 It has an international remote first shared culture built around common memes 3 It is technologically harder than most web apps which has a selective effect Crypto is what comes after Silicon Valley. Yeah but the point is that they match up transactions in a crypto company's database with the public transactions on chain. And the latter are taken as being the gold standard of truth. Which means they understand how Bitcoin and Ethereum use cryptography for tamper resistance. Companies really operate as business networks today not stand alone entities. Actually a fairly sophisticated way of thinking about what network capitalism really means. It’s the natural extension of APIs cloud remote and so on. More porous business boundaries. Strong work by Ernst and Young Btw many people don’t realize that the Big Four use public blockchains as the gold standard of truth when producing audited financials for crypto companies. Because they can’t be falsified. So blockchains have already transformed accounting. The VR Picasso is a cryptographically verified original. Sometimes it really is the case that more technology is the solution to a problem inadvertently caused by technology. The trivial example being a bug fix. I actually agree with about many of the negative features of today’s social media. But I don’t think the answer is the regulatory state but rather new tech that fixes these issues both in the form of crypto and new products . No matter the format or author the arguments arrayed against the social media giants by the professional chattering class boil down to three broad classes arranged in rough order of intelligence •Luddism •Regulation •Antitrust Let’s examine them each in turn. That’s a good critique. I didn’t generate the chart and so don’t know their methodology. But if they did something like what does a giant flat panel screen cost today vs 30 year ago you can get 10 100X reductions. Certainly for computers you get there. Massive sectors of course that have spawned political movements to end all student loans and give free healthcare because they are so expensive Also Yeah but why does Baumol happen? One reason is that those tend to be highly regulated and subsidized industries where you can’t cut costs because it’s illegal. For example until this year telemedicine was hobbled because doctors couldn’t practice across state borders. Yes exactly these are the big areas. Also on the original chart housing appears to have kept pace with wages when aggregated over everyone. But other studies claim that rent has grown faster than wages. That fits experience in urban areas at least. The other thing is that the chart by itself doesn’t show how much of someone’s spend goes to education healthcare rent as opposed to TVs amp phones. Of course this varies on per person basis. But that means the bite of price inflation or benefit of deflation is felt differently. No it shows wages in the center of the chart with some things growing faster and some things growing more slowly. You could renormalize the chart in wage terms making the wage line flat and it’d look similar. gt shows wages growing faster than virtually every category No it shows wages in the center of the chart with some things growing faster and some things growing more slowly. You could renormalize the chart in wage terms making the wage line flat and it’d look similar. You are both friends so no need to fight At least for this question just one part of the whole I think we need to look at granular time series of which countries are buying treasuries in each month. Hard to see trends from aggregate charts. The inflation is here it’s just not evenly distributed. See graph. I expect this to get even more intense over the next decade hyperdeflation of the digital inflation of the physical such that the digital version of anything is the first choice. What would you consider an alternative empirical test? Would like to understand what would invalidate the MMT worldview. For example would other countries choosing to use other currencies beside the dollar count as evidence against MMT? The empirical grounding is the success of the alternative namely the size of the cryptoeconomy. Today in the hundreds of billions. Will grow to trillions and eventually tens of trillions. They are shifting strategies now due to the trade war. They will refocus on domestic consumption and Belt amp Road. I love that we’ll be able to put our philosophies to the empirical test this decade. As we discussed last year I anticipated this showdown in the 2020s. Didn’t realize at the time that COVID would accelerate it. But of course MMT enriches crypto folks so it’s complicated I agree with the spirit of your comment though which is that leaders of vision would be welcome BTC is very much above board these days. Mainstream and Wall Street adoption etc. Disagree for many reasons. 1 The state isn’t a competent capital allocator. See COVID SF CA etc 2 Everything needs an ROI even a bridge or tunnel. See Strong Towns 3 It’s all going remote so road infra for non self driving is rearward looking. Btw I want someone to make a better version of this graph over the long term as it crops the y axis. Still it does show the directional trend. Hard to imagine China won’t liquidate more after the TikTok thing. Oh I am familiar Love the movie which says the US economy is a tank of water and that money printing is not just something we can do but should do. Ultimately these kinds of policies benefit crypto people so I can’t really argue against it but Indeed ask me about Bitcoin It’s only gone from 0 to 100B in ten years. It’s not just US debt. The dollar is a technology platform. Every country that trades with the US that buys oil for that denominates contracts in and so on subsidizes the dollar. The main value right now is as a Schelling point. If not our national currency then what It augurs a new phase the phase of explicit empire. That will result in grudging compliance accompanied by an intensifying search for exit over the medium to long run. It’s like Oracle the vendor people hate. They can milk it for sometime. But not forever. I’m bearish on the US baseish on China but bullish on the Internet. Bitcoin is currently the 35 currency globally. Will probably be top 10 after next run. And it’s valued by many Americans AND Chinese. Hence it’s the long run winner. gt no matter how profligate the government gets the dollar is the last wealth reserve This is a TINA argument. But the alternatives are coming DCEP BTC . As the US becomes increasingly nationalist and socialist it just becomes a worse business partner for other countries. It’s true that incumbency has an advantage. And buys you some time. But China is launching DCEP and BTC is at 100B and the US government is printing trillions of dollars. None of that augurs well for the US dollar over the long term. China has been exiting treasuries for a while. Why would you buy US treasuries? Yield has been falling off a cliff. Yes. But they can’t point those guns at the whole world to force them to hold dollars. The endgame of MMT is extremely predictable. Capital flight the end of the dollar as a reserve currency the end of the US as a global power etc. Thank god for Satoshi. Things at this scale can take decades or generations to play out. Kick the can and pass it down one more decade or generation. It’ll be a worse problem but not your problem. That’s been going on for a while. Who knows how long it has left to go. Well MMT does mean BTC holders will become millionaires. Along with everyone else of course. Of course prescriptive MMT doesn’t make any economic sense. The only logic behind it is that the state has guns. Krugman at least is smart enough to get this. I haven’t actually seen an analysis that totals up all the fiscal and monetary stimulus thus far this year. I remember when a 787B stimulus package was a big deal. Now we are at 10X that number Though we don’t know to the nearest trillion how much the state has spent. America is now a welfare state in a novel sense of the term a state which depends on the welfare of other states. It prints trillions of dollars. That’s its primary export. Dollar holders around the world subsidize the increasingly insane hijinks. Eventually that will stop. Yeah. Regulation is information. You hear about the false positives. The bad things that got through. But the false negatives also exist. The good things that didn’t. The current system isn’t set up to carefully track both of these rates. Much of it is TSA style safety theater. Google Eroom’s law . US regulations drive up the price of drug discovery. As do patents. The American state makes drugs artificially expensive through these two mechanisms of artificial scarcity. Given the egregiously poor performance of the CDC FDA and indeed USA in the COVID 19 crisis many countries are reassessing whether they really want to outsource biomedical regulatory policymaking to the US. Not something to imitate. Harmonization is a word many don’t know. It’s a process of carrots and sticks by which American regulations become global standards. Note that the bureaucrats who write these rules typically have career tenure. They can’t be fired and weren’t elected. Regulatory harmonization exports US hegemony. That is a small number of American regulators accountable neither to the electorate nor the market write the biomedical policies for the whole world. For a country like India to actually be sovereign it needs its own rules. That’s too harsh. Plus he’s plenty well off to be able to exit without issue. It’s more about thinking ideas through in public. Blockchains can be thought of as massively multiclient databases. Every user is a root user. Good analogy The 21 theses of institutional decentralization. Human subjects research of course adds cost to any replication. And you might decide to lean on a previous study rather than incur that cost. But at some point you may need someone to voluntarily take an informed risk. We would never be able to fly without test pilots. See Everyone repeating what scientists say adds no signal. Independent replication is the core of science not institutional reputation peer review or endless repetition. If you tell me you reproduced the research I might believe you. If you tell me scientists say then I’ll just ask you for the original paper. From the open web to the open chains. Twitter. I’m serious. Just engage with investors on here. You don’t need a warm intro just a great demo or screenshot that fits into a single tweet or DM. No guarantees of course. But you just need to attract one. The STARK forest This is why social networking is not a winner take all market. We need different channels for our different contradicting online personas. Fascinating. Post encrypted messages on public social networks such that only your friends can decrypt them. Basically turns any platform into an E2E messaging app. Will be interesting to see if this behavior is adopted. Interesting concept. Maybe a little too manual though. Wouldn’t you want it to look like a standard indented list of bullets and then just display outlines at levels 1 2 3 4 by just hitting a single button at the top? Some HQs are legacy. Some folks have bought houses. But fundraising has moved online and that’s the big thing. Not just Zoom pitches but rolling funds and of course crypto. Especially at the angel and seed level people are getting more comfortable writing a check remotely. Love ’s feed. And he’s a great salesperson. But one remark this is starting to sound like a pitch for Europe. Hey the weather is nice and the restaurants… A huge shift from the obviously world dominant capital of tech to a place you need to pitch people on to stay. The argument for CA nowadays boils down to scenery. I get it. But there are a lot of beautiful warm inexpensive places with good internet. See and to find some. The main asset of the Bay Area was the in person network. No more. This really shows what Twitter could be. Imagine if cards were useful for doing something Exactly. It’s one thing for pre existing companies to continue using SV as a legacy base of operations. But now that you can raise online and work from anywhere would a new company really put the expensive dysfunctional Bay Area at the top of the list? Neptune and Browserstack seem like classic SaaS though I may be missing something. I like Plotly but not sure what their latest business model is. Rough analogy Twitter issues usernames when people sign up. Usernames are valuable amp there is a decentralized marketplace in names. But Twitter didn't set the price. Similarly issuing karma tokens badges NFTs or usernames ENS to users might result in organic value. Note you can do this without putting any price on the token. No ICO. Just issue it to users like a social reward similar to karma or likes or badges. If the community puts a price on the token or NFT that's then an emergent property. Organic decentralization? Yes that's one approach. But essentially the proprietary part is the community. Which can be quantified by paid subscriptions to a community forum holding of a token or both. Yes.. The token is used to buy time from developers in their marketplace and to access API itself. Here's an old piece i should update with coins vs tokens . tokens are not equity but are more similar to paid API keys Thesis many SaaS companies will eventually issue a karma token or be outcompeted by one that does . They set up a developer marketplace StackOverflow equivalent where experts earn and charge crypto karma for advice. Would work for Figma Mixpanel etc. The consulting model didn't scale because you had to keep finding great engineers and selling their time by the hour. Hard to do that endlessly. The community model does scale because essentially each community member is buying time from each other. You're just the moderator. Open source business models. Consulting v1 open source the code sell consulting Cloud v2 open source some code but sell a closed source cloud complement Community v3 open source all code and issue a token or charge for access to the community Yeah. A good augmentation mechanism might be to generate a list of suggested named entities and then allow the user to say yeah nay across them. Move extremely fast and break the sound barrier Amazing accomplishment. I'm actually not arguing for centralization. If the evaluator has a repo with the code to assess some Project Euler style problems and the applicant has a separate repo with the code to solve these problems then you can put them together such that evaluator can score applicant. 4 It is moderately hard to fake as copy pasted code would be somewhat obvious. You might defeat much of this with automated item generation in which variations of a given Project Euler style problem are created from a random seed. Why might this be a good standard? 1 It has the quantitative element did you get the answer right or not? 2 It has the qualitative element what does your source code look like? 3 It is fairly general you can apply it to any quantitative domain in science or engineering. How could we develop a global portable verifiable standard of technical ability? Institutional name brands are an expensive noisy signal. One idea is a repo with individually hand coded solutions to Project Euler like problems for multiple domains. For more than two centuries…the USA has stirred a very wide range of feelings in the rest of the world love amp hatred fear amp hope envy amp contempt awe amp anger. But there is one emotion that has never been directed towards the US until now pity. Already an American passport which once allowed easy access to almost every country in the world is no longer a valuable travel pass. Because of the coronavirus American tourists are banned from most of Europe Asia Africa Oceania and Latin America. That former aspiring Stanford or MIT computer scientist…isn’t just going to sit…waiting for the moment when they can enter the gilded halls of the U.S. of A. It’s the internet era…The frontier is closed here and it has moved elsewhere. You’re right. I think it’s more that the visual metaphor chosen doesn’t suggest the variety of different rankings people have. I don’t know the right visual but it might be more Tower of Babel than Tower of Culture at the present moment. By the way every item on the list with the partial exception of GTA is consuming rather than producing. It’s a 20th century broadcast state of mind. Culture as something you consume that’s fed to you. As opposed to something you do like lift weights or fly drones. For example if you take all the people who could understand the Feynman Lectures they could probably appreciate Hamlet. But not conversely. You could show this by exam or maybe Turing Test equivalent. So this imagined tower isn't even close. It's missing the cloud above. Interesting items for a v2 ranking The Feynman Lectures on Physics The Art of Computer Programming The smartest Twitter accounts and the dumbest Websites beyond TMZ GitHub Twitch 4Chan Legacy media outlets in 2020 where they are vs where they think they are You can't get away from ranking. Otherwise Google wouldn't exist. But this exercise shows these ranks to be very much in flux with important actors left completely off the map as well as any acknowledgment of how much individual disagreement there would be about ranks. This is remarkable on several levels. It's recent note the mention of Game of Thrones yet immediately archaic It has zero reference to math physics technology texts It ignores the descent of many formerly high institutions into clickbait Incredible meme potential. The cultural skyscraper as the new political compass. Glad we agree Can't express everything in one tweet of course but that was the sentiment. Good to see you working on modernizing India It's very new that an app built by 12 people can reach a billion while the nation that put a man on the moon can't ship a website control a disease or count votes. Legacy institutions built before the internet that haven't been aggressively modernized won't be competitive. gt isn't large and nimble gt small and nimble Sometimes often not. It's extremely hard to be large and nimble nowadays. And large and nimble might beat one small and nimble but often not 1000 of them. Any organization founded before the internet may not survive the internet. That includes many brick and mortar businesses. See next tweet Large and nimble gt small and legacy After decades of development our robotic future is finally happening. Flying drones legged dogs grasping hands talking androids. Don’t call it a comeback been here for years etc. Nice piece by . One remark I’d make is that these are baby CLI interfaces that don’t typically allow people to rm rf their files but do give people a taste of industrial strength computing. NLP has also become more packaged robust and reliable over the last decade. The basics like stemming amp NER work reasonably well out of the box. Now we can start leaning on them as subroutines to create works that wouldn’t have been possible without them. Btw I’m well aware that NLP techniques have been used under the hood of billions of search queries over the last twenty years. But explicit conscious invocation of NLP to add value to documents is new. It has been more subtle in Word amp Google Docs like better grammar checkers. A command line tool to automatically create tags in your text files for import into . It’s a group of young students so please be kind with feedback. The consumerization of natural language processing is beginning Maybe so. Don’t know how valuable those parts really are in terms of resale value. But any thief would be recorded and possibly face recognized which would be a deterrent. Yes a real dog may have the advantage in smell and taste. But in sight and hearing and certainly in memory and understanding of human directions Spot is probably far beyond any traditional dog. Spot has accessories by the way. And ports to plug stuff in. If these price points are real Boston Dynamics has a shot at completely owning the guard dogs market. There are many ways in which robot dogs are better than live dogs for this specific purpose. Unkillable remote controllable networked equipped with video amp microphone etc. If you look at most tweets people are scared of this thing. Of course they would be It’s headless and moves kinda weird. Classic uncanny valley. But a degree of fear is the property many want in a guard dog like a Doberman or Rottweiler. So security seems like the use case. Boston Dynamics seems to have raised only 37M. They will be at 35M in revenue if they can sell even 500 Spots at 75k a unit. Security patrol seems like the application that can justify the expense. Basically a mobile security camera with a whoa factor. Someone could instrument TikTok and run some experiments here. Maybe use a phone farm in case they actually have a UDID equivalent rather than a non persistent string like identifierForVendor . Today the tools we typically use to measure electrical and magnetic fields are themselves sophisticated pieces of gear with solid state components a kid couldn’t make at home. That’s not how things started out. For example Maxwell’s equations have far more impact if you first see exactly what Coulomb Ampere Faraday et al were working with. What exactly did their experiments look like? What data did they collect? What did their articles look like? Then you appreciate Maxwell’s leap. What I want is a VR exhibit of every major discovery in science. Put on the headset and walk through a digital museum. See Faraday discover electromagnetic induction and watch the Wrights invent flight. See the apparatus they used the experiment in 3D and then the equations. It’s handling hundreds of billions today. Imagine if the state actually worked with technology rather than against it. In fact we don’t need to imagine. You don’t have to think they are the good guys to realize they are way ahead in some areas. Yeah that’s why it has to be something like a hardware wallet or equivalent writing to a decentralized database like IPFS or a blockchain. The cryptography and consensus algorithms guard against many single machine issues including bit flips. gt There is a chain of custody then involving police officers and sworn judges These are agents of the state that have suffered reduced trust. The fundamental issue is that not enough people trust the state to count votes properly. Hence personal digital audits via private key. If an outlet published dangerously inaccurate early COVID 19 coverage like don’t wear masks or just the flu and did not retract on their own you know they have no self correction mechanism and can safely ignore. Immoral clickfarms that will publish anything for a buck. The ideal business model would incentivize corrections at least as prominent as the original article to all readers of the original. With software we push bug fixes immediately. One issue of course is that bad software doesn’t work at all but bad ideas are more abstract The lack of coronavirus retractions shows that Vox Media can’t stop worshipping fakeness Absolutely amazing that they and other orgs still haven’t formally retracted the early coverage. Ethically bankrupt media corporations incapable of reform. Need to build something better. Yeah I’m familiar. Harder to get a bug like that if you use a hardware wallet or equivalent to vote and record everything on chain. A bit flip on one machine wouldn’t pass consensus. Moreover you start with local elections then build success amp fix then move to national. After the current insanity ends perhaps at some point in 2040 the post apocalyptic US will turn to tiny Estonia by then probably 50 years ahead and ask it for guidance like Deng did from LKY. We’re already past that point with 40 mail in ballots this election. This is the last area of society to modernize and the most resistant. Every other service is online. Billions of dollars are sent every day electronically and securely but we can’t get this right Blockchains show that we can get to global consensus on contentious votes with private keys and public verification. After the predictable train crash in November people will start to argue that it’s not democracy if it’s not digital. It’s possible. But that has to be weighed against the problems caused by delayed mail in paper ballots without publicly auditable links to individual human beings. Enough people do not trust the counting process that it needs to be far more transparent amp individually auditable.   A we should be able to vote online B no many experts say it can’t be secured and paper ballots are actually less risky C well paper ballots may cause a slow motion train crash in this election so what about private keys personally auditable votes like Estonia? Figure out how to build a new ship. Other societies like Estonia Dubai Singapore and yes China modernized their legacy institutions. The decision of the East Coast establishment to resist technology rather than modernize will be the subject of 1000 histories. And it’s so much more than social media. It’s not just about small vs large. It’s about nimble vs legacy too. Small and nimble? Digital native. Large and nimble? Digital unicorn. Small and legacy? Dying in 2020 unfortunately. Large and legacy? Dying in 2020 painfully. The internet makes small organizations far stronger and large organizations far weaker. Instagram shows how much you can get done with a few aligned people. And the government shows how little you can get done with millions of disaligned people. The stock market isn’t the right measure of economic health. The distribution of citizen net worth would be far better. Similarly we need to start thinking about health holistically with life expectancy dashboards for different demographics. This is one area where people of many different stripes agree. Bank bailouts amp quantitative easing represent the upward redistribution of wealth as per Cantillon . Note that DCEP itself may or may not be blockchain based. had a good thread on it. Perhaps we should think of it as just a major upgrade of China’s financial infrastructure to be developer first with first class payment APIs accounts etc. But that’s still big. As and both note this is a big shift in coverage. In theory you can separate centralized blockchain and decentralized crypto but in practice this seems to be laying the groundwork for rollout of the Chinese DCEP the new digital renminbi. Write an update as a GitHub or GitLab paper Good ideas here involving journals as GitHub repositories. Every paper a subdirectory anonymous peer review via anonymous pull requests editors as admins code as the primary artifact. Every sufficiently large commit log does have horror mystery and comedy. The big thing about any idea like this is making the authoring flow as easy as it currently is and ideally easier. For example you could take something like JANE and run it over all the text in your buffer to auto suggest references. Or libraries. Academics spend a lot of time on citations. What if all these reference managers like and could be turned into software libraries? The next version of BibTex might treat citations as code not text. Yes. The thing about math is that an unproven but plausible assertion is termed a conjecture. Not a theorem. If you turn more citations into import statements you could go further towards identifying the number of truly independent replications of a scientific assertion. Great term. The next step after reproducible research may be composable research. Perhaps you fund 100 people at say 10k each to make their existing work composable. Start with or an outlet that is already aligned with these ideas. In the same way that good code can be often used without reading the manual a good scientific paper can often be boiled down to a few key assertions. CS is the most obvious place to start. Each journal a code repository each paper a library? from nips import smith.2017 If we take reproducible research in the sciences seriously the paper is a human readable adjunct to the code and data. The main conclusions of many scientific papers should be expressible as equations API calls or entries in a probabilistic knowledge graph A binds to B . How many academic citations can we replace with import statements? The Yahoo index didn't scale to the whole web. But maybe it doesn't have to. Maybe what you really want are digital monasteries in which a specific community curates links from a given area. Like Wikipedia Yahoo 1.0 social network. Roam is one place to try this. Github too. Note also this doesn't need to be Ethereum based. It'd be fun to see if one of the newer chains could support this more easily. By issuing free tokens on a new chian it's also a good testnet like thing to play around with wallets familiarize with block explorers etc. The fact that this is expressly for fun and essentially the on chain version of StackOverflow karma or badges should make development much faster. Only the admin user pays and only to manage the SaaS dashboard amp pay for gas costs of creating contract sending tokens etc. How might this work? Mostly a SaaS app Standard Django for most of the app including billing logins etc But the sheet state is written to the blockchain And user's fiat credit card buys enough crypto to pay for the writes eg buying enough ETH to pay for gas Note that you don't need all of a spreadsheet's functionality. It might in fact be a fixed template with two sheets All historical transactions All current balances Undos would be in red font. You might add an option to disable undos and go to production mode . Wanted a blockchain based spreadsheet for quickly creating a new token or NFT issuing it to people in your community tracking awards to specified wallets and logging history. Not an ICO as it's not sold. Just issue a token for fun. Like on chain karma or badges. Static analysis Dynamic analysis Formal verification? Perhaps the next generation of blockchains will require developers to run formal verification prior to writing an updated smart contract to the chain. Continuous verification as the new continuous integration. The Remembrance Agent RA is a program which augments human memory by displaying a list of documents which might be relevant to the user's current context. Unlike most information retrieval systems the RA runs continuously without user intervention. I'm very sorry to hear about your loss Venkat. The internet has spread American culture and the English language to large swaths of the world. What if we pushed back on that somewhat? After all American society isn't much to emulate anymore. The technology is. Can we factor the tech part out and model healthier cultures? Immigrant parents might offer the following deal to kids play any video game you want so long as it's in your mother tongue . Bake translation into single player games as a way to preserve cultures. RPGs in particular have plenty of text to read and conversations to have. Technocultural preservation 3D scan historical areas and record volunteers speaking in their mother tongues. Then deliver an immersive VR experience. Children might be able to learn any language from good enough NPCs particularly if their behavior is programmatically pedagogic. Probably if the ceiling is low enough. But probably not before they get a good visual written to the cloud. True sci fi would be mapping that to face recognition and a microphone like in the Devil's Advocate. Call out the burglar's name in a deep robot voice. Dystopia beckons Here's the new LG PuriCare face mask. With two H13 HEPA filters dual fans respiratory sensor and rechargeable battery it's the state of the art in post apocalyptic outerware as you traverse untrusted zones. Protection from smoke SARSCov2 surveillance. Here's the new Ring security drone. Rather than N fixed cameras you have a single patrol drone that captures everything. Like a flying Roomba it'll only work indoors at first. But an outdoors version may follow if this is a hit. Here's the Spot robot dog by Boston Dynamics. It's available at 75 000 today. If they can sell even 1000 or so of them worldwide the price will likely come down over time. And it can be accessorized. America 2040 Twenty years of civil unrest have subsidized the widespread adoption of autonomous rottweilers and bald eagle drones. Never leave home without your unkillable robot companions which videotape every encounter and can be infinitely resurrected. Hire globally. Only hire above the mean of all employees. That's the Lake Wobegon strategy a way to increase the quality of an org as it grows. But it needs equity alignment or equivalent to incentivize people to recruit folks more skilled than them. Yeah something like this YouTube or podcast link gt gt transcript gt RoamNERd gt Roam In theosophy and anthroposophy the Akashic Chronicle is a compendium of all human events thoughts words emotions and intent ever to have occurred in the past present or future. Reproducible research is also a critical piece of the puzzle. New grad students can be onboarded by just recursively descending into function calls till they hit original citations. Jon Claerbout deserves some kind of prize for founding the discipline. Of relevance is this excellent post on how YouTube specifically and online video generally is enabling tacit knowledge transfer. Possible crossover event a group of fellows apply NLP to reanalyze a set of 100 books from a historical period. This could be the foundation for a new academia based on the decentralized quantitative study of the humanities. For example take all the books from a particular era of say Russian history. Digitize them upload them throw NLP at them translate them get indexes of people places concepts sentiments. Get time series get stats get a bird's eye view. Then annotate collectively. If we take the existing roamcult community build natural language processing tools into Roam and the open versions and start collectively reanalyzing historical periods amp great works of literature you could have a totally new generation of pseudonymous internet scholars. The idea of computational history has been around for a while but if you can just paste in a collection of related texts and a get all named entities b have them all linked together c get detailed stats on n grams and so on…that decentralizes commentary out of academia. Now we're talking. Excited for where this goes. Basic natural language processing techniques like named entity recognition can provide new windows on existing texts. A new era of decentralized commentary dawns. A bit confused. Of course no one should pay fees to companies if they can figure out a better alternative. That might mean coding their own exiting to another platform building a coalition with comparable economic leverage etc. Operative word is better though. Ideally ridesharing gets decentralized into a crypto protocol so that a all drivers get a share of the upside and b a single centralized corporate intermediary doesn't even exist. Will happen eventually may take 10 20 years. While the App Fairness folks have a good problem statement their vision page involves ten somewhat messy vague asks. Better to focus on one thing an eat what you kill policy which allows devs to bring their own cards amp rails. The App Fairness coalition might make a single ask from Apple. 1 If the user chooses an Apple ID associated payment method 30 to Apple 2 If instead the user logs into an account with a pre existing card or the dev implements their own rail no fee But that interpretation would also be text or some kind of multimedia and also thus hashable and storable on chain. So it would still work for narratives. They're just a layer up from pure machine readable raw data. If cryptocurrencies endure and if we can extend them to accommodate much more in the way of storage a future wannabe Stalin wouldn't be able to take down the proof that these inconvenient photos once existed without crashing the entire digital economy. As Orwell put it they who control the past control the future. And they who control the present control the past. But an undeletable digital history is outside of anyone's control. Which will make things like this impossible. We’re in the year 11 AG after the Genesis Block. Jan 3 2009 marks the true start of recorded history. in the sense of cryptographically verifiable digital history I'm not sure Ethereum is the place for it but a chain that integrated Metamath would be very cool. It would be interesting to put a Metamath proof verifier on the Ethereum chain. It would let anyone set pseudonymous rewards on mathematical proofs. By 2040 it's not true if it's not on chain. Every dataset every physical law derived from that dataset every paper explaining the derivation of that physical law and so on will eventually be on chain. If you're saying something is true you can now show your work. And must. Btw original image was from the famously lengthy Principia Mathematica. This is a good blog post that explains WHY it was so long. Short reason is that they didn't have some aspects of modern notation so had to copy paste code. After all formal verification is finally having its day in crypto. When it comes to smart contracts the stakes are large enough to make it worth bringing out the big guns. I invested in to help bring this math to market. Good overview here A blockchain is a collection of cryptographically verifiable assertions. As more kinds of facts get logged in the ledger of record we may be able to algorithmically reason our way to some interesting conclusions. Or this but unironically. Yeah. We need a synthesis. Be able to rebuild all past dependencies from scratch and then add a new layer. Without the ability to create the new there is stasis. Without the ability to recreate the old there is degeneration. This is cool but may gain more traction if adapted to be a frontend for smart contracts. Reason many smart contracts do accept arguments but current block explorers don't have a great UX for inputting them. So this could make crypto more accessible. What this suggests is that the civilizational equivalent of being able to code from scratch is more important than realized. It's not enough to simply push a button. We need to be able to rebuild from scratch simply to continue as a civilization else maintenance is impossible. Cargo culture That's the perfect term actually. Cargo cult culture. We think we have capabilities that we really don't because we repeat what our ancestors said without being able to write something worthy of them let alone surpass them. It's the difference between stock amp flow. If new books aren't being written in a language if new people aren't being trained in manufacturing the flow has been cut off. The culture that surrounds us is then just the stock and it's being depleted without anyone to replenish it. This is a microeconomic explanation for how Idiocracy happens slowly. You think the cultural capacity is there because the artifacts are all around. But the culture producers are actually slowly vanishing and their descendants can only repeat not create. This is similar to partial bilingualism the ability to understand a language but not speak or write it. Common among children of immigrants. If children can't write the scripts of the parents if their access to ancestral culture is read only that culture won't be replicated. Read only culture Suppose you were raised in a religious household but didn't practice yourself. Growing up with these civilizational scripts means you can recognize them perhaps repeat them but cannot write them from scratch let alone explain them. So too for a society. These next gen block explorers are pretty cool. They show what you can do with other types of data on chain besides just transactions. Visualizing price data on chain by Visualizing spatial data on chain by Company is Quilt Data Here's the link to their search engine This is pretty sweet Search engine for public S3 datasets with built in visualization tools and links to Python Notebooks. Great place to learn how to parse genomic or crypto data for example. A more complex advocate may take a price oracle feed do some calculations and render the results as charts in an article. Importantly if published via reproducible research a reader could individually verify every assertion drilling all the way down to raw on chain entries. Oracles and Advocates. The simplest oracles are the feeds of cryptographically verifiable financial data which are already being put on chain. The simplest advocates are posts that cite these oracles by directly linking block explorer entries. Example The rise of crypto oracles means we can eventually factor many academic papers and articles alike into a feeds of cryptographically verifiable data and b a reproducible research style narrative layer on top. In theory by 2030 2040 or whenever open state databases eg blockchains IPFS can scale to internet scale workloads you might simulate the privacy impact of an action prior to executing it. See second part of this talk There were many implicit privacy assumptions in the pre internet world starting with the premise that either a you were friendly with most of the folks you walked by in a small town or b you were de facto pseudonymous to most of the folks you walked by in a big city. Basically we uploaded the entire world in unencrypted form to the internet. Now we need to encrypt it again. Sort of like Jane Jacobs for the digital world. Restore shade privacy structure community. Once we moved from the trusted internet of academia to the untrusted internet of the 90s we introduced SSH HTTPS and other encrypted protocols. Perhaps the next step is to start encrypting names. Go from John Smith to johnsmith.eth to foobar91.eth and fizzbuzz32.eth. People are adopting search resistant identities. Treating their real names like social security numbers gradually doing less with them online only using them in official contexts. We may see the Google Facebook Twitter era of unencrypted real names online as anachronistic. Great piece by on what the pseudonymous economy might feel like in a few years. I have a feeling that the current period of being able to find information about random people online without their consent will go away. It's all encrypted identities by 2040. Network effects on datasets arise when you can join them together. Ignoring heterochromatin due to difficulty in mapping cloning or assembling these sequences excluded upwards of 10 of the genome from these initial drafts Now twenty years later we are finally able to fill in the blanks. If we treated ideas like we treat software we'd push updates to all readers when there was a correction to a piece. proposes the same concept how do we reach people we've misled…mass direct messaging to everyone who shared or fav’d a tweet Nationalist monotheist Internationalist polytheist Decentralist atheist Assuming no inflation every voluntary exchange is already zero sum with respect to money and positive sum with respect to wealth. The question is what of the economy is still engaged in wealth creation. As happened with farming robots may make this a smaller than we think. Like Oracle's incentives for Postgres adoption the local government is very thoughtful in helping companies quantify the cost of continuing with their current service provider. Bay Area government finally getting behind technology in a big way Extremely farsighted and selfless move strongly incentivizing remote work and the decentralization of tech out of the Bay Area. Note that he announced on Instagram. Even the tech CEO who owns a giant media corporation decided to go direct rather than be mediated and potentially distorted. This is becoming standard. Bezos is opening up a network of free preschools. First one in Washington State. Is that right? I'd always read that he used a water clock. Will check it out. More precisely an accumulation of phenomenological laws and empirical data collected over many years gave the raw material for Newton and Maxwell to put together their syntheses. The equations are clean amp deterministic but the process of getting there involved messy data. The laws of motion are often conceptualized as deterministic equations but they too were inferred from data. All that nostalgia for idealized visions of the 1990s or the 1950s or whatever historical period but in video game form. Hollywood set designers have already done a lot of the work. Need a tool to scan period films and upload 3D models of all clothes and objects. VR will make it possible for people to live in previous time periods. Also we know that millions of new people are becoming investors. Crypto amp Robinhood make that obvious. The main q is whether this stays a part time hobby or becomes a more common full time job. Social is about 10 years ahead of fintech crypto and gives something of a clue gt Unless you just put your money in a fund and let other people manage it. And that option is available to everyone. Choosing a fund manager may be a little like choosing the CEO of the company you're working at. Except you could diversify and also manage some yourself. One response is someone still has to do the jobs. But the share of farming jobs crashed even as the population rose because we got really efficient. Perhaps robotics similarly reduces manufacturing share. And then perhaps investing becomes the main post manufacturing thing. This was my initial thought process too. But robotics is getting really good and if the cost of robots is just electricity and parts then that means capital can substitute for labor. Perhaps if you are a bad investor you just invest in good fund managers. Similar to picking a CEO when choosing a job. Of course you can always strike out on your own or diversify. Exactly. As robotics expands into more areas the cost of labor becomes electricity which is the cost of capital. So dialing up a factory is eventually just capital allocation. Yes. Relatedly imagine if all this money went towards people building up equity stakes rather than paying down debt Put another way could someone choose to substitute their capital for their own labor? Something that informs my view is the state of robotics. It's getting good and in 10 20 years electricity capital may substitute for much manual labor. What does adaptation look like? I agree that some forms of finance are transaction costs like ATM or wire fees. Other forms like startup investment create or scale new businesses which are an engine of economic growth. In a sense working a job is investment of labor rather than capital. Can we substitute? That's true. But there is a solution for that which is to follow a fund manager and give them a slice in return for allocating your capital. It's similar to picking a CEO when joining a company. Except you can diversify more. Yeah that's reasonable. Everyone has a day job and some people tweet or invest. That's where I started too. But maybe we are underestimating the endpoint of the current transition. We've increased the number of investors by 100X. Maybe that has huge consequences. Not sure yet. Universal Basic Index basically. Like a basic income in some respects but with the added element of skin in the game. By default reinvest and compound at the societal rate to pay for robot rental. In this world capital allocation becomes the job robots find hardest to do. I'm still developing thoughts here but just as a thought experiment What if all of society was by default invested in the equivalent of an index fund and the dividends from economic growth provided the basic income ? You can opt out and take more risk but at your option. In this hypothetical world everyone is micro investing every day the 10000 micro exit is kind of like the viral tweet what would have been college money seeds your fund picking a fund manager is like picking an employer robotics gives a low scarcity basic lifestyle Many bemoan the financialization of the economy. But perhaps we lean into that. Perhaps investing is what people do in a robotic economy if they don't want to be founders. Investing is similar to consumption. Just click to buy. Picking is hard. But you can join a rolling fund One way of measuring this what percentage of income do people derive from investments vs wage labor? We think of wage labor for a salary as the default today but the transition from farming to manufacturing was a big change. An improvement in some respects and not in others. Farming was the 1800s. Manufacturing was the 1900s. Counterintuitively could investing become the most common job of the 2000s? Reason crypto and fintech are turning everyone into an investor just like the internet turned everyone into publishers. How far does that go? That's true but the detectors seem fairly expensive to set up which is similar to mining or staking farming etc . Yeah but while we can engineer higher speed blockchains we can't change the speed of pulsars. Still they may be useful for some applications. What's the cost of setting up a detector? No. If you want to die that's your prerogative but please leave everyone else out of it Universal health care isn't enough we need eternal life. Figure out the science then make it inexpensive amp universally available. Ideally a pill. Opt out if you want of course. gt Those who create life extension technologies will be profit driven People who built smartphones were and are profit driven. This resulted in billions of poor people getting phones. Similarly to maximize profit from reversing aging you make it available to everyone. Moreover because life expectancy is a ratio scale variable like height we can measure it reliably across space and time. By contrast the poverty line changes over time for various reasons. So it's harder to agree on what eradication would mean. It's actually the opposite. If we had a cheap treatment that could reverse aging amp restore youth not only would this crash healthcare costs it would give people many more earning years in the prime of their lives. Finite life expectancy is the root of scarcity amp hence poverty. Who are you? Tony says. The new guy looks crestfallen. Greg Ritchie he says. Then when no one seems to react he jogs their memory. President of the United States. If you read the essay you'll see that the measures you mention poverty inequality etc ultimately stem from scarcity of resources. That scarcity arises because we have a finite number of hours on earth. Remove that limit and remove scarcity. All the measures you mention are economic metrics that are ultimately subsidiary to quality of life. Historically an important measure of the latter is in terms of life expectancy. No because that means N different servers by N different educational institutions each of which can go and will go and has gone offline or change formats. A blockchain or something like IPFS provides a single point of truth a common file format and total uptime. Where you'd probably start this though is with financial data. Every archival data point currently accessible via the Bloomberg Terminal but on chain. A number of NBER type papers could then be turned into Jupyter notebooks where everything could be reproduced by hitting enter. That last step posting raw data points directly on chain with digital signatures rather than merely putting aggregates online via a state agency site might seem like a small thing but it would allow for total independent reproducibility by pulling all data from a chain. Covidtracking is one of the best projects I've ever seen in terms of data integrity. If you go just one step further though you could double click on say 1000 cases reported by a given state to see 37 hospitals in that state each posting individual data points on chain. For example goes to admirable lengths to show data provenance. You can track back each case to individual state agencies. But you can't track it back to the very origin which is a hospital reporting the data to the state. If every data point was on chain you could accompany it with proof of X Proof of who who made the measurement Proof of when it was made at this time or earlier Proof of where where it was made And so on A chain of custody for individual data points on chain. Premises Many papers are based on datasets Those datasets are rollups of individual data points like measurements on an individual The datasets and sometimes the raw data points are currently in silos like NCBI or Bloomberg But you could put them on chain If you combine reproducible research cryptographic proof of X and federated analytics you can envision a world where every paper isn't just reproducible but where every row of data is logged on chain with all relevant proof of Xs to demonstrate data integrity. Someone should set up a site like Scott Aaronson's Complexity Zoo but with all the proof of X papers and code. How many bits of randomness can you generate from pulsars in this fashion? A related question is whether the pulsar noise is random enough to pass various tests eg like Marsaglia's DIEHARD battery but more modern ones . I found this cite on the topic So if I understand correctly it's similar to using the block header hash of the next Bitcoin block as a random number generator. It's not known to anyone in advance it's confirmable to everyone after the fact and it's globally accessible without man in the middle issues. The idea of using pulsars as a globally available retroactively verifiable random number generator is interesting. I need to understand more about how you'd acquire the signal cheaply. But you could imagine each frame being hashed with that info and continuously uploaded. Can you explain exactly how the pulsar signal would be acquired in your model? Would it be just a new sensor in modern smartphones or something else? Yes but freedom is still valuable. And will be valued on the other side of this transition. Free speech free markets free thought free trade freedom of contract freedom of movement freedom of association…all of these freedoms and more are being abrogated. We'll need to safeguard protect and restore them with encryption. Not naively rely on legacy institutions. It's going to have to be the cloud of the free. The land of the free may be over for some time. I understand the sentiment here but the global internet will continue. It will just need to be based on decentralized encrypted protocols. With distraction it's even harder. Many businesses today rely upon social media as a distribution channel. Every company is now a media company. Yet with all the competition for attention social media is like the handicap radio from Harrison Bergeron. With competition you might have some rule like wait before three customers mention this competitor before taking them seriously . Though that may mean you react too late it means you only react to likely real things. In many ways it's like angel investing with your time. It's hard because these are 95 rules not 100 rules. You usually want to be aware of what the competition is doing but run your own game. Yet sometimes that isn't possible. Similarly with distraction. Ignoring the competition is just level one. The real task for founders today is ignoring the distraction. Note that China itself has been protectionist in this fashion. Setting up a company there often meant setting up a joint venture with Chinese nationals. Or getting your company banned. But the precedent may be contagious to Europe and other locales. Second order consequences. For better or worse we have deprecated the previous era where US tech companies were the free speech wing of the free speech party and the US championed free trade worldwide. Now it all shifts gradually to encrypted protocols. I like the ideas behind but my understanding is that they depend on a set of trusted beacons right? So it doesn’t use existing hardware. Let me know if off base. I think it’s now easier to rebut at scale. It was easy to fake at scale back then Mr. Jones is well worth watching. Shows that the problems of official misinformation we’re dealing with have been around for generations well before there were social networks or messaging apps You might do something where the challenge depends on a private key being available. That would be something the real node may be hesitant to copy over to a VPN. And if so the extra real node to VPN latency might cause it to fail the challenges. What about VPNs? These are tricky for distance based methods because you’re remote controlling a computer with some latency that actually is physically in the claimed region. You might make the challenge depend on a private key which you wouldn’t want to copy to the VPN node. That is indeed a way to spoof location that’s hard to overcome by a distance based method because you are remote controlling a computer that is actually physically in the claimed place. Finally it goes without saying that ping times are a highly imperfect measure of physical distance. They can rise for reasons like network congestion that have nothing to do with a node moving further away. Nevertheless they are lower bounded by the speed of light. Incentives TBD but roughly speaking you’d want to incentivize nodes that had high uptime reliable locations and the compute to issue and pass many challenges. And you’d want to slash or penalize nodes that spoofed their location. This is a form of independent verification. If you introduce probes with known to you locations that issue challenges to other nodes and yet the reported location of other nodes doesn’t change that’s good evidence the protocol is working. Importantly if you ran an organization you could put your own servers on the network with fully trusted and known locations. And you could prioritize the response to their challenges when looking for nodes with spoofed locations. So you might not get a guaranteed location out of it. But you might get something like this node was close enough to stationary servers operated by different entities to pass many challenges over this time interval meaning it was likely within this coordinate ball. Some nodes in the network would be stationary while others would be phones or tablets. The protocol wouldn’t be hardcoded to trust any particular node but stationary servers run by organizations like Pingdom or PagerDuty could accumulate many location confirmations over time. A node that claims to be at a given x y location at time t will get many challenges from other nodes that report being near to it at time t. It’s incentivized to solve and return these challenges as quickly as possible such that compute time is small relative to ping time. For a pair of nodes with reported locations the speed of light gives a lower bound on how quickly info can go back amp forth. Obviously network topology can dramatically change ping times. But a node should be able to solve more challenges more quickly from nodes it’s nearer to. Specifically suppose you have N nodes each of which is reporting a time varying position x t y t over a time interval with M time steps. Any node which purports to be near another node can be challenged by an equation that it must solve amp return as quickly as possible. With respect to proof of location you can’t naively use GPS because it can be spoofed. You might go with trusted towers of known location but that’s centralized. Another approach may be to assume K of N nodes are honest reporters of GPS and use speed of light as a constraint. I'm agnostic on any given decision here but I do recognize that overwhelming demand for block space is a good signal for the sector. Early internet companies needed to minimize bandwidth just like early crypto projects need to minimize on chain traffic. But bandwidth and chain capacity both increase with time. Fee pressure is painful but good in the long run. It leads to technical innovation within Ethereum eg zk rollups and migration to other chains. A financial incentive to scale and decentralize. No single measure is ever perfect but it's similar to exponential backoff. You raise the cost of certain kinds of actions. It's also possible to vary the price by locale which Twitter does know to first order though this can be spoofed with a bit of effort . A simple expedient might be to keep account creation free but add a green check for a 5 paid account. You might then allow everyone to read but only green checks to comment on posts. That's almost as messy as crawling because 1 the Referer field can be faked or left empty 2 the global state of who has what backlink is still fragmented across server logs 3 the backlink isn't updated at creation time but rather click time which is very different Yeah. The next step is a zero knowledge version. Crypto domain names integrate usernames pseudonyms websites payments messaging encryption hosting reputation discovery login and more. Fun thread. Also gets at a deep point. Internet communities share digital worlds but not physical environments. Engagement and value add beyond just the content itself. Updating books for the digital environment rethinking them now that we're 20 years in. A Kindle is just putting a book online. What does the digitally native version look like? Yes Great idea. Value added curation basically. A genre that should be more common on the internet. We do see this for listicles and device reviews. But could do more with it. There have been a few apps that do this but I haven't seen a really fast way of sketching on your tablet and instantly seeing it on your desktop. It'd have to be as fast as opening the camera and somehow context aware. Probably doable if tablet and laptop are on the same wifi. Yeah. One of the first things to build with the Roam API should be an importer to index old notes from orgmode Evernote and the like. You might be able to preview that in a separate graph before adding it to your main or keep it separate . I'm familiar with the area actually. Many years ago we coded a biomedical search engine based in part on supervised learning to infer ontological relationships. Set up the whole thing as a large imbalanced logistic regression. Roam solves that in part. It's like what Google Knol wanted to be a Wikipedia with property rights. So it's not a trustless environment. You are viewing the NLP index on the dataset curated by the person or group with admin rights to a particular Roam graph. gt how do you deal with spam and adversarial docs That's one of the cool things about this. You are only doing this on published books. So the underlying dataset is way cleaner than the web. Curation workload is also manageable because there are only say 1000 books on a topic. Dublin Core is useful for metadata on individual citations like an electronic card catalog but you may need domain specific ontologies to do proper NER for text on say the Great Depression or cancer genomics. If this adds enough value perhaps the next generation of authors will open source their books load them into Roam encourage annotation updates interaction and monetize by charging for the community rather than the content. You want to do this for one time period to debug the NER and demonstrate the value proposition. As you add genres you'll need to address new difficulties eg Unicode . Once it works for all old books then extend to Sci Hub amp Kindle? See related tweet Idea the next Google Books 1 Take a collection of books from Project Gutenberg or Google Books on a given time period 2 Apply Named Entity Recognition to build a cross book NLP index 3 Load this into a public Roam graph 4 View what N books have to say about a given event Doing that for one book would be interesting. It'd be fascinating if done for a curated collection of books that all talk about the same events places people. A new kind of index a cross book NLP index. Different from web search because the underlying dataset is much cleaner. Do you have a demo Roam page where you can show how well it works? Another concept is that we may want to distribute a block explorer with a wallet as a part of the client software. The block explorer is the desktop application which allows the user to view what's happening on chain. Or it's a piece of such an application. The concept of crowdchoice how the internet will permit collective bargaining with governments. I had a discussion on this with and a while back that did a great write up of here The basic idea is that CBC is much easier to design for than pure P2P. With pure P2P problems like discovery indexing or contentious global state eg leaderboards become difficult. There are workarounds like magnet links. But also failures like this In the CBC model clients often read and sometimes write to a central blockchain. Writes are costly and cost coins. One tricky part is that there are also other nodes miners stakers farmers that host the B of the CBC. But using an existing public chain may obviate this. CBC client blockchain client An alternative paradigm where every client has a local crypto wallet some coins and a local relational DB. It leans on a central blockchain to find other clients and route messages to them. The local relational DB is used to cache amp index state. MVC model view controller dominant paradigm for web apps. You have an ORM on top of a relational database the model that processes commands from users the controller to render requests the view . An important corollary is that blockchains can be part of a protocol rather than the whole thing. Many protocol designs become easier if you can assume that all peers read and write to the same global database. From MVC to CBC client blockchain client? Looks easy to try python3 roamNER v1.py Would be awesome to be able to specify arguments at the CLI to run this in batch and also to package this up. Then remove Roam's upload limitations amp hook it to the Roam API. Finally make it part of Roam. I decided to try and make a working implementation of Named Entity Recognition in Roam. The upsides of this are enormous being able to instantly cross reference ideas from any written content is huge for researchers students hackers of all stripes. gt thought an index wouldn't scale Yes. That was true. It was and remains a gigantic undertaking to crawl the web and build that index at Google. But by 2030 2040 or so open state databases may scale to provide a public realtime Common Crawl like index. A fundamental new primitive that blockchains offer for protocol design is tamper resistant global shared state. Why weren't bidirectional links part of the original web? Because you need global shared state. If A links to B at time t how does B know about it? A could message B. Or A and B can both be indexed by C. C was Google. Now it's also Roam et al. Eventually it will be on chain. Grep and the like are too slow because they're doing linear scans. They aren't an index. Slack isn't the same because it's just a messaging app. More comparable are orgmode Notion Evernote and other note taking tools. Roam optimizes for a certain kind of PhD like brain. Just merge the pages by renaming one of them to the other. It'll update every position where one is mentioned. This is useful if you have multiple names for the same thing john johnsmith John Smith and so on . No because if you have 100k words of old notes you still need to identify what to tag in the first place. You can do something like cat notes.txt tr n sort uniq c sort k1 rn less to get a word histogram but named entity recognition can do better. It defaults to daily notes to encourage you to write on a daily basis but you can build out individual pages as well. It's less work than a wiki because it does a lot of auto suggesting. Once you define a new tag which you can do with one character foo at your convenience you can go back and click a few times to link any or all past occurrences of that tag. People often name bidirectional links as the core concept behind but it's more like semantic annotation of text. Next step would be to make this even more automatic. Ideally paste in text get automatic tag recommendations and then manually approve. Some common questions You can use either foo or foo to designate a page You can collapse john and JohnSmith into one page You can autodetect old mentions of foo You can build up tags for people places ideas You can in theory link these tags across repos One tweet summary of . Type a sentence like Had meeting with JohnSmith about defi You get a page with all meetings meeting a page with all mentions of a person JohnSmith a page with all mentions of a concept defi It indexes your text. If a roamcult member wants to try this I’d love to see what some basic Named Entity Recognition applied to a corpus can do. Can you automatically ingest a bunch of text files identify recurring important entities and define backlinks pages accordingly? I liked ’s idea of 280 character email limits. Or something like Discord where there was a rate limit on how many new emails could be sent in a given time period. Maybe it’ll take crypto to innovate on new messaging protocols. Well in the event the US has a contested election as seems likely the Bush Gore 2000 outcome of having the Supreme Court decide may now be off the table. With a 4 4 deadlock does the confirmation decide the election? There are various arguments from different sides to shut down international tech platforms. The emergent result though it’s never called that is internet censorship. This is why it all moves over time to encrypted protocols. People speak somewhat ruefully and somewhat jokingly about the before times but does appear that pre 2020 will be thought of as a different world. The year the old order ended and the year the Internet truly began. So if you were born in 1981 1982 for example you were literally the last graduating class to finish college without social media being part of the experience. The Oregon Trail Generation remembers the world before the Internet. The Generation remembers the world before 2020. Crypto is similar. Non college origin. But it didn't spread in tech amp media but rather in tech amp finance . So it's still underrated in media amp youth circles as it doesn't solve problems for them yet. It also skews older than people think because crypto starts with investing. Excellent troll. Taking the premise seriously Twitter had a different base than Facebook or Snapchat. It wasn't a college phenomenon initially. It spread among 20 30 somethings in SF amp NY in tech amp media. That early cohort gained many followers and is still influential. This is interesting. Conscious consumption of time. Even more interesting if every app could display that number when you tap it. One vision of the ideal app is the one that gives you maximum benefit for minimum time invested. Learn a skill or earn money in five minutes. Why is Twitter memoryless? Everyone must drop everything to focus on today’s most important thing. That means forgetting yesterday’s most important thing. The ledger of record promises to radically expand the scope of mathematically verifiable facts. And thereby reduce the impact of MITM’d science. Most people aren’t consciously using computers for computing. More for storing things digitally and looking them up. But we could. Anything that can be reduced to a series of mathematical operations can now be independently reproduced on billions of phones laptops and tablets. Like having your own cloud chamber or inclined plane at home. Yes they have done very well. Satya has led an incredible turnaround. Jobsian in terms of value accrued at least but less flashy and in some ways more difficult didn’t have founder level legitimacy to change things . You could only vote for algorithms no one can update anymore. Those that have reached their final state. Tricky but in theory possible Algorithmic governance. Already happening in crypto to some extent in the sense that people are voting with their wallets for smart contracts. An algorithm makes truly binding campaign promises and is fully transparent. It will do what you say not always what you mean It’s not Microsoft in general it’s and his team Seven Billion Netizens. Bet on the internet bet on decentralization bet on crypto bet on encryption. Over the long term these will prove to have the most enduring global constituency despite the coming age of national balkanization. Neither an American Century nor a Chinese Century but an Internet Century. It’s hard to get a monopoly on anything. If they manage to get a VR headset to scale someone else will create the Android to their iPhone. Oculus Quest is amazing. Oculus Quest 2 looks to be even more amazing and is coming out in October. Facebook somehow got really good at hardware. There are also bad actors on the internet. That doesn’t mean we ban the internet. If India bans programmable money it will set back an entire generation. Meanwhile China is building a blockchain powered city Looks like the purported Indian crypto ban may be exaggerated. That said the time to speak is now before any law is proposed An Indian crypto ban would be like an Indian internet ban. Guaranteed to put Bharat behind. The time zones of the world. Some interesting spreadsheets to make What is the distribution of world population across time zones? What about in 3 hours from that time zone? What is the distribution of tech clusters and unicorns? How does time zone overlap with other criteria like rule of law? This page lists all the countries of the world grouped by time zone. Synchronous remote is indeed much easier than asynchronous remote. Though you can hire night owls or early birds in other locations remote teams are partitioned by time zone. A good complement to the course A list of the most important recent AI papers. For remote Americans this may mean Canada and Central South America get a second look. Also an opportunity for well positioned cruise ships once COVID is over. One edit to this companies will pay to keep teams in the same timezone for synchronous communication. I’m not the first to observe this but historically humanity was organized by latitude. Remote might reorganize the world by longitude. With gt 50 of waking hours spent in front of a screen much more of people's daily experiences become amenable to cryptographic verification. Everything that passes in front of you on a screen was at least stored on a computer if not generated there. Science is how we understand the natural world. But math is perhaps even more useful in the constructed digital worlds that we spend more and more of our time in. This suggests that we want to reduce as many assertions as possible to mathematical rather than merely scientific statements. There's actually much that can be done here using NLP public datasets reproducible research and the ledger of record concept. Normally we don't think of math and science as being in tension. But it is true that math gt science gt religion in terms of rigor and reproducibility. Billions of phones means anyone can now independently reproduce any mathematical statement. But not all scientific ones. Math is harder to MITM than science. Mathematical claims can be independently reproduced on anyone's computer while hard to reproduce science has to be taken on faith. As such we should reduce as much as possible to hashed timestamped verifiable math. From 2013. No scientific law prevents 100 people who find each other on the internet from coming together for a month or 1 000 from coming together for a year. As that increases to 10 000 and beyond we may begin to see cloud cities materialize out of thin air. No incentive no consensus. In many not all places where the word decentralized appears we can profitably replace it with the term community to give a different perspective. Centralized hosting is corporate hosting decentralized hosting is community hosting. Decentralized hosting is community hosting. The one upside of a widely accepted but false premise is that by clearing it away you can often unlock new mathematics and science. Fundamental falsehoods are true opportunities. Mathematics teaches you that there are statements which are intuitive plausible and false. Today you can hit enter and make just about anything happen in the cloud. How far can we take that in the physical world with construction drones delivery robots and autonomy?

Note that even this reference to Jurassic Park depends on Hollywood itself. If you recall the scene from Jurassic Park where they splice in amphibian DNA to spackle over the gaps that's similar to what media consumption has done to your brain. The gaps in your knowledge have been filled in by TV and movies. These are unreliable narrators One other note the ledger of the record may be the only way to re establish common truths across different tribes and countries. On chain posts are for the record posts. A higher level of polish than merely putting something online. See also If you think it might be important some day you need to post it on chain not simply online. Posting it on chain is like entering it into the Congressional Record or having it notarized except it's at a much higher level of confidence than that. Basically blockchain or gtfo. Is that right? Would love to see if you have a link. 4 The concept can be generalized. Current blockchains give reliable proof of who via digital signature what via hash when via timestamp . Proof of location would add where. Other proofs would extend the scope of the ledger of record. And allow querying on other axes. Typo Merkle root 3 Some on chain video would be public while much would be encrypted and hence private . But simply having this spatiotemporal on chain index would enable anyone to formulate a query message the authors and pay in crypto for footage of an event from multiple angles. Caveats 1 Hashing content wouldn't prove the footage was real. However it would show that the footage existed at this time amp was posted by this entity. 2 Many efficiency improvements are possible. For example you could hash every frame amp periodically post the Merkel root. On chain video search Imagine a crypto camera that posted a timestamped signed hash of content on chain. If you also had proof of location you could do a spatio temporal query for all on the record footage in a given x y z t range. The immediate followup is how many contentious statements can really be adjudicated this way? Right now it works for crypto. Eventually that means all of finance. Then as more of our world becomes digital more of it becomes hashable and timestampable and thus provable. This is the promise of the ledger of record. Anyone can independently confirm statements made on social media by inspecting a blockchain. PostgreSQL specifically and open source databases generally for quite a while now.

Could be a useful teaching tool for example Cloud first land last. But not land never. Could be a faster way to turn an internal tool used by engineers into something the company as a whole can use. Even if the CLI's arguments are untyped you don't need to modify code either. Define an external file that maps options and arguments to input fields. CLI to UX Idea given a command line program with explicitly typed arguments it should be possible to autogenerate a simple localhost based web UX. Map a text argument to a text field a date to a date picker and so on. Has anyone done this? Incredible visual metaphor. As the physical world fails the digital world offers a seeming workaround. It restores the vision that state failure took away. But ultimately we still need to breathe. Digital exit is a temporary respite a tactic but not the answer on its own. Why is there more creative work for a tech company than an open source project though? A big project like Django or Ethereum is as complex as a tech company. Maybe it's because the customers are the creators so there is less market research no sales process etc? Hm. Is that true or is it that open source projects tend to be CLI driven and so what you're creatively collaborating on is text vs images and so that's easier to work on remotely? If can identify the active ingredient here that might help with remoting existing cos. This is also a good response. Open source often becomes corporate sponsored with offices once it reaches a certain level of traction. Still it's typically remote first and highly distributed. That's true but does that map to remote vs in person? You can collaborate on a frontend remotely just like you can on a backend via Figma or equivalent. Though maybe a command line interface IS easier to remotely collaborate on as it's pure text? open source is for and by software engineers who are most comfortable with remote first yet there are many in person tech companies building dev tools open source would be even better if it could fund office space but why can it be good at all if in person is needed? Some possible reasons open source is a hobby so quality doesn't have to be as high but there are high quality open source projects open source is all volunteer so management isn't the same but there are certainly manager style decisions for merging PRs Open source projects tend to be remote first simply because there is no budget for an office. Why does this seem to work for open source to a greater extent than for tech companies? I think we need to rethink these for remote. Twitter shows remote serendipity is possible. Video games and social networks are the native form of remote socializing rather than Zoom coffees. In person will always have value but it's also expensive. It'll vary but I think the pattern will be 1 Start remote first or in a small group somewhere in the world 2 Optionally pick an office somewhere when you get your Series A That is colocation will be a conscious decision. Remote first reduces burn in early stages. Observation there isn't a single remote Schelling Point like Linux that everyone can contribute to. No open source Zoom due to hosting and bandwidth. Maybe there's room for something which is to Zoom what GitLab is to GitHub? Perhaps it has a different form. Remote first will rapidly improve. All major tech companies and countless startups are working on this every hour of every day. The ultimate dogfooding. Twitter is actually v1 of serendipitous remote interaction. A polite Twitter replacement would be a breakthrough. Other metonyms that may be retired Detroit self driving amp electric is happening outside Wall Street NY finance is becoming fintech crypto Hollywood many factors pushing decentralization of film Madison Avenue has been cloud first for a while It's not Silicon Valley anymore. It's Technology. Tech is now remote first. Moving to the Bay Area is no longer necessary. And outages fires prices and dysfunction are driving out the people already there. The place is less appropriate as a metonym for the concept. This is not to say these companies are evil. They have created valuable services that do difficult things hosting broadcast etc . And in the 2000s and early 2010s the free aspect was huge. But now it’s time to renegotiate the social media contract. Crypto is key here. Relatedly a 3.50 CPM for Twitter means a million view tweet earns roughly 3500 for Twitter. Views are private while likes RTs are public. But you could estimate the correlation for any individual. And estimate how much they have made for Twitter vs how much they have seen. At 10 CPM 2B views is indeed 20M in revenue. That’s not net of course but you might get gross margin from public statements. Just publishing a spreadsheet with these calculations may start pushing folks to decentralized media. Money is the simplest way to quantify this but you may also only want to view posts that make you take positive actions in the real world. Lift weights run eat better write your article push your code. Proof of work to post amp to view. Buy time from others by adding value. As attention becomes more scarce and crypto advances you’ll eventually be paid for a larger fraction of the posts you read. Going from 0 to gt 0 changes psychology. You start thinking about viewing posts that have some material benefit to you vs say making you mad . By the way for quite a few people foreign students these two processes already coincide. So it’s not THAT new an idea. But would be newly mainstream in some countries. You could stick with your default country the one you were born in. Much like in state tuition for state schools. Or you could try to go somewhere much further away. No right answers but it puts a new twist on leaving your home at the age of majority to learn something new . Imagine if 18 year olds filled out country applications rather than college applications. Anything we’re doing through a phone will involve sensors and actuators. On the sensor side I can see us getting farther with pure imaging. But many techniques still require molbio for sample prep eg sequencing . On the actuator side I don’t see any way out of using molbio. Some argue that caffeine enabled the industrial revolution. This sort of feels like an OS level thing. Right now we have lots of apps messages and todos floating around but the context is entirely on the user to put them together. Even something as simple as you usually open these two apps together could be inferred from the OS log. A v0 might just be defining a list of apps Gmail Terminal etc and then assigning them as icons to each task as you create it. Then you can sort todos by app context and execute a bit more mindlessly. That would also create training data. Could you actually do this? The AI would have to read your mind in a sense. But given a database of many completed tasks it might learn that send note to X meant opening up an email while calculate Y involves a quick spreadsheet. A sufficiently smart todo list wouldn’t just let you check off items. It would open up exactly the apps you need to complete the task and no more. Did we? I think the internet has boosted productivity dramatically in some respects but also increased distraction for many. I’m amazed when I think about how productive earlier authors were without word processors internet version control. Are we focus limited now? Tech has focused on attracting your attention. It now needs to devote attention to restoring your focus. People’s mental models of distant times and places. Of industries they haven’t participated in and of professions they haven’t worked in themselves. They know on some level that Hollywood isn’t real but they don’t know what is. If you haven’t studied something in depth your mental model of it often implicitly reduces to a few scenes from a Hollywood movie. Original post Apple’s ARKit is now quite good. Viewing with a phone is unwieldy though so I expect AR glasses eventually. Thesis the only citizens that explicitly sign a social contract are immigrants. From a reader I spent an unusual amount of time on social media this weekend as I had a successful tweet going viral within FinTwit. Below is my daily resting heart rate pattern. No other change to exercise or diet. You can clearly see the spike. The Compromise of 1877 was an unwritten deal informally arranged among U.S. Congressmen that settled the intensely disputed 1876 presidential election. Perhaps humans can just get addicted to feeling righteously angry like they can to sugar or alcohol or nicotine. If so this is a superstimulus we need to identify and consciously limit in our information diets. Has anyone studied whether wearables can detect changes in heart rate or blood pressure from viewing social media? Perhaps if we could see what it’s doing to us we might use it less. I don’t think I ever said that? Perhaps you are thinking of or someone else. I don’t recall ever giving trading advice. This banger brought to you by well known technological progressive . Worth a follow Electrical stimulation may speed wound healing. Robotic telepresence is getting better. gt Our work leverages a pre trained image inpainting model 45 to fill in pixels that are not filled through temporal propagation. You’re right that their algorithm includes deterministic parts. But they use this paper from 2018 as a critical subroutine. Telepresent exoskeleton. Iron Man on demand? AI video editing is getting very good. Hollywood at home. Ah. I think the point is to eventually innovate in the physical world again. But we will have to go digital first for a while. Btw this is a very recent phenomenon. In 1990 for example you couldn’t live on the internet . It was maybe barely doable in some US regions in the year 2000 and more so but still hard in 2010. Now digital America is everywhere because the Internet is everywhere. Consider the following choices 1 physical America digital America 2 physical America only but no Internet 3 digital America only but not being physically in US Thesis less people would rank 2 above 3 today. Which means much of the US value prop has moved to the cloud. Over the last few decades a significant part of the value proposition of being physically present in America has been digitized. COVID and remote have accelerated the digital and further reduced the value of the physical. The cloud is becoming primary the land a parameter. Suppose we view it as Physical America vs Digital America. Seen from this axis much of the physical world is locking up amp malfunctioning. Meanwhile people migrate to the digital world because things just work there. Given the alternative you pick the digital alternative. Yeah but in that essay you will note that I distinguish detailed technical concepts from trivial ideas. A well written fusion energy blog is something in between a full nuclear engineering textbook and an offhand comment. It would educate and inspire action. It doesn’t come out of the entrepreneur’s stake. It is a referral bonus the investor gives to the author. Same logic as all advertising lead gen and content marketing. Investor pays for referrals that convert. Except magnitude and time scale are qualitatively different. It’s screen time vs earth time cloud time vs land time. More than 65 of respondents spend gt 50 of their time looking at a screen. We’ve quietly all mass immigrated to this thing called the Internet from our home countries. At least we spend half our time there. Virtual reality amp virtual currency can make this more than a metaphor. One part of this is certainly the whole Russian bot thing. But another underappreciated factor is the extent to which non American English speakers simply by virtue of posting amp upvoting on social media influence the US culturally as well as politically. Yes been true for some time. Non Americans don’t have a vote but they do have an upvote. That said Atom style custom keymaps would be awesome to do at some point to obviate the issue I see Conor had the same thought These keybindings are standard in many editors including TextEdit Google Docs and Terminal itself.

Wait you’re saying social media corporations and media corporations may have incentives that are not completely aligned with the population at large and the health of the republic? The Great Acceleration? Crypto is to cryptography and distributed systems groups what AI is to stats and machine learning groups. The sudden attachment of a monetization engine to academic research accelerates progress and turns professors into founders and executives. When you put it online you get distribution sharing collaboration etc. When you put it on chain you get immutability verifiability monetization etc. On chain is not suitable for everything just like you don’t put everything online. But it may actually be broadly useful. On disk Online On chain On chain is like the third level of deployment. Files that only you care about stay on local disk. Files that are important to others get put online. And files that are really important to others get put on chain. Yeah. Hard to educate people about that in time but one can try. Perhaps the ideal might be to report no intermediate counts until they are all counted. If the 20 point swing towards mail order ballots described in this video is real that dwarfs every other factor. It’s like COVID 19 in January. We can see it coming. An election without a universally acknowledged winner is now a likely eventuality. First 3D printed drugs have actually already been FDA approved The printer lays down thin sheets of powdered medication and droplets of water based fluid bind these layers together at a microscopic level. Also this may go without saying but we’ll want some pseudonymity zero knowledge based version of the login process to protect financial privacy. First we can get it to work with toy apps though. Btw defi is a multi year thing. There will be ebbs amp flows as with everything in crypto. It’s quite possible that the current boom crashes hard. Or that the login system happens on another chain. But Login with Crypto will happen. Many forces pushing in that direction. Ethereum names will be the new Facebook accounts. There's an initial killer app to get people to sign up. For FB it was collegiate social networking. For Ethereum it's defi. Then you get decentralized single sign on for the crypto ecosystem. Log in with Ethereum. That would be an interesting next step to allow users to filter a feed by proof of economic alignment. For every article you read you can determine if the authors are on your side in a cryptographically provable way. Only works if they hold crypto If social markets become the new social media and crypto turns a billion people into investors then fast but accurate information becomes key. If you're basing financial decisions upon information you want those providing that information to show proof of economic alignment. Great point So all commercial real estate becomes like datacenter space? An Amazon warehouse is like an e commerce datacenter A cloud kitchen is like a food datacenter A clinical lab is like a bio datacenter All become robot driven facilities with nondescript exteriors. Love this. 24 hours a day x 7 billion people on the planet. To paraphrase Rutherford physics is sensors and actuators. All the rest is computer science. Yes this is a joke. Yes of course physics underpins computers. But for those people living in a constructed digital reality the impact of physical constraints boils down to I O. This is a startup strategy but it's more than that. It's a way to think about every institution. How can you turn it into a computer brain with sensors to sense the physical world and actuators to act upon it? See also Manna from Marshall Brain The Internet Age is just beginning. Of course analog to digital amp digital to analog converters are important. They are our sensors amp actuators. But everything should be thought of as happening on the computer first. That's the primary form. The physical world just a printout. Eventually virtual real estate via crypto domains. The Internet age is just beginning Money spent on commercial real estate starts migrating to virtual estate. You're not talking about a mere ad you're talking about paying top dollar to be at the top of the UX As important as physical location once was In a sense this isn't new. Social feeds have been around a while. But what's new is the deprecation of the 20th century economy thanks to COVID. As every restaurant moves to the cloud their position within Uber Eats amp DoorDash's UX is the new downtown. As every restaurant and legacy business moves online commercial real estate matters less. The new location location location is position position position. Everything is about your position in the feed. Put another way to feel that things were getting better over a 20 year period the improvements to your personal and societal utility need to be worth being 20 years older. This is not impossible but is a fairly high bar. It's certainly possible for things to get quantifiably worse. But you could factor utility into at least two terms personal utility and societal utility. As someone ages personal utility declines. So other factors would have to rise dramatically to compensate. To what extent do people idealize the past because they were younger then? Social markets as the new social media. Bitcoin Centrist is a good play on words. Centrist as in the center of the space to give BTC its due. Centrist also as neither a nocoiner nor a maximalist. It’s also literally true that at a one person startup the founder CEO is the lowest paid employee. Is there a crypto angle? Yes and a Mastodon angle. The ability to come to consensus on a single number in an adversarial environment like a vote count or an upvote count is a necessary and perhaps sufficient condition to establish trust at scale. Context Stalin reportedly said those who vote decide nothing those who count the votes decide everything . Apocryphal but might be rooted in fact see below . What we didn't anticipate is a society where you couldn't even properly count the votes Those who vote decide nothing. Those who count the votes decide everything. But those who can’t count the votes can’t decide anything. I’m not sure if anything can be done at this late stage of the game. But future historians may point to the cause and effect between COVID 19 and this outcome if it occurs. Everything went remote to varying extents but we weren’t ready for a remote election. Here's the full article. The analysis is by a Democratic group but the numbers are non partisan. Hawkfish CEO comes across as a sober citizen trying to raise a warning about a plausible outcome. This doesn’t even strike me as sci fi or implausible. This seems to be the outcome we are barreling towards. Because the claimed 20 point swing to mail in voting can be measured now. If real it is larger than any other likely swing. This is a concerning and plausible scenario for how a contested election happens. The apparent winner on Election Day could be reversed by record numbers of late arriving mail in ballots. Both sides then cry fraud. For the people who don’t get this a number of billionaire CEOs have come out of middle class beginnings via the YCombinator incubator. During that period they typically earn far less than market rate and want to become ramen profitable . YCombinator? The Internet. If you can make it there you can make it anywhere. Once you really nail the analog to digital interface and its reverse and commoditize the hardware as has happened to once magical microphones telephones printers monitors etc then the entire game happens on the internet. Win there then press enter to win in real life. Of course the analog to digital and digital to analog interfaces are nontrivial. Genome sequencing VR headsets digital currency 3D printers this gets the offline stuff online and vice versa. But once it’s online we’re off to the races. What I like about your book is that it squares with a lot of thought on why it’s most powerful to do things Internet first . Build it in the cloud then hit enter to materialize it. A printer a 3D printer a drone flying at your command a robot hand People often prefer constructed realities because they are more interesting more fast paced. Wait years for a real tree to grow or see it sprout in seconds on a screen? Related to ’s thesis An interesting visual metaphor is to think of a viral idea as being like a fast growing plant. You can imagine a VR environment where one day everyone is just walking around and the next day these gigantic viral redwoods have sprouted up around everyone’s house. The printing press is arguably part of this. Bible and novels. It’s all on the continuum. As tech and media advance more of our daily lives are taken over by interesting human constructed environments like Twitter as opposed to physical realities. The next step is VR. What’s in common among people who imagine they can reconstruct a distant past who are deluded about the US present who have visions of a better future? They are all focused on the virtual realities depicted on screens. So we are the unreality based community. Having spent a lot of time thinking about virtual reality and virtual currency I thought virtual everything was relatively new. But a huge insight of this book is that we’re continuing on the deep cultural track laid down by Hollywood and the Transcendentalists before them. Bruno’s thesis is that America is increasingly becoming a virtual society focused on make believe above all. I have to agree. This novel vantage point unifies many otherwise opposed schools of thought. Fantasies of the past delusions about the present visions of the future. The Founders Fund manifesto makes the case that tech has slowed down or reversed. 1 Transportation top speeds have fallen since Concorde was retired 2 Drugs costs for drug approval have skyrocketed 3 Energy real costs of energy have also soared That’s a good correction. It’s not my site but may be able to update it. One major issue we don’t have an unambiguous metric for progress. So people can argue metrics. However if you must pick one we can make a strong case for life expectancy. In that arena progress was exponential but has more recently decelerated and even reversed. Good thread and important discussion. It’s tacitly building off Thiel and Cowen on the Great Stagnation. But we should engage the counterargument which is The first believes they are building a genuinely beneficial product not hawking some flim flam religion. The second believes they are building a genuinely important movement not hawking some flim flam company. Let the market decide I’m pitching something in their individual self interest not some kind of moral precept. My conscience is clear. The will of the people I’m advocating a moral precept not something in their individual self interest. My conscience is clear. When the sale gets high stakes enough and you are pitching a senior executive and this could be a politician or general as much as a business leader then the economic and ideological cases often overlap. Let the market decide vs the will of the people These two philosophies reach an interesting limit in the case of sales where one person’s will is how the market decides. The internet gives us information and productivity but also distraction and procrastination. Tynker is a kid’s app which integrates coding into the game. Maybe these are also coding competitions and companies play to see who has the best competition programmers? I really wonder if companies could somehow play each other for real stakes or to settle disputes somehow. Maybe a charity purse. One version is companies playing against their competitors in an e sports league. Sort of like Ford playing GM in baseball except it’s Google vs Facebook in DotA. The rise of crypto domain names VR NFTs and remote work means the Internet century is actually just beginning. Extremely impressive review of the latest in virtual estate. Wait till the billions of dollars we were wasting on San Francisco real estate is spent on VR offices. Corporate budgets for social networks and video games have yet to be unlocked. Wait till the billions of dollars we were wasting on San Francisco real estate is spent on VR offices. and I discussed this in the before times. If you want remote socialization for your company you can 1 invent new remote rituals amp hope they catch on 2 repurpose the polished social apps amp games maintained by multibillion dollar companies that your whole team knows Remote work we know. Remote play is social networks and video games. They weren’t built with remote in mind. But they are more organic than doing artificial Zoom coffees with the team. Investing is now remote first too. But how do you build the relationship if you can’t meet in person? Well investors are actually more accessible online. You can hang out with them on social networks and sometimes video games. No scheduling needed way easier than coffee. A somewhat counterintuitive point you don't need that large a following to bootstrap a new product. Even a few thousand folks is enough to start testing out ideas. The upper limit of your company size is determined by how large that community may be in 10 years not today. People will often debate whether team product or market wins. In the influencer first approach the community helps define all three. It creates the market articulates the problem and pre identifies at least one credible team member in the persona of the influencer. Founding influencer is now on par with founding engineer. An influencer with an organic community can identify a problem pair with a technologist crowdfund a solution and continuously communicate progress along the way. The community derisks the process of market discovery. You can 3D print a drone. Yeah. Feels like Google has gotten worse for old queries in particular. I'm also more excited about datasets like Common Crawl which helped enable GPT 3 and might enable more innovation in search. This is very different from the dotcom crash. These are fairly healthy companies paying to get out of SF. In summary Don't come to SF for tech Do get out of SF if you can Big numbers outweigh anecdotes More companies will follow We're finally decentralizing technology. I think the transhumanism vs anarcho primitivism axis while weird seeming actually surfaces deep underlying differences that are usually unarticulated. For example is technological civilization on balance good or bad? This debate was held at Stanford in 2014. Full video here Zerzan encourages everyone to give up civilization and go back to a hunter gatherer lifestyle. And I encourage everyone to do more to speed up technological and scientific progress. It was a meeting of polar opposite views Zoltan vs Zerzan. If you think through the underlying motivations of our needs they all turn back to keeping ourselves and our species alive. Now that we have technology should we not try to add a layer on top of the existing pyramid of needs and shoot for figuring out life extension? No. I think China may show how far people can push control. But the encrypted Internet will hopefully show how far we can push freedom. The legal dimension may be smart contracts. Let's see how far we can push blockchains by 2030 2040. The physical dimension may be materialization into startup cities. As for jurisdiction there's already a process for turning unincorporated land into a city in many countries. With the Internet we have the possibility of building something more egalitarian than America. Billions of people won't become US citizens. But they are Internet users. Can we use that to deliver not just information but jobs rule of law even digital citizenship like Estonia? Put another way America's decline is often paired with China's rise. But the CCP system isn't globally attractive in the same way the US system is or was. The Internet however is globally attractive. To Americans and Chinese alike and more besides. The truly counterintuitive point of view is that the American century is over but the Internet century has just begun. The ideal is to found these startup cities on bare land filming the entire process with an explicit memorandum of understanding with the host government. Songdo is an interesting precedent. In what sense is the Internet the successor to America? With virtual reality and virtual currency the digital frontier becomes more than a metaphor. Gather in online communities with mutually agreed upon governance. Eventually crowdfund to materialize cities in physical space. Machine translation may soon connect the world. We could see a step function jump like GPT 3. But perhaps we also want machine obfuscation. Imagine opt in software which flagged scissor statements that could split your community and disemvoweled them. Like a language barrier. For example anything that's popular on American social media may be filtered by the app. Or it automatically detects scissor statements via NLP amp downranks them. These are just ideas. It could be simple no English no US based posters or complex. But it would be different. Sharechat is an interesting Indian app whose innovation is keeping English out. This simple firebreak keeps the US cultural goliath out and gives local cultures room to share. Perhaps you could do a different twist on this which filters out American social network craziness. The purpose of a startup city is to do something you can't do in a legacy city. It makes tons of sense on paper. However while remote spokes are doable meaning individual contributors remote hubs are hard meaning managers . The reason is that so much of management is reading emotions going for walks eating lunch together keeping people happy. As remote first becomes the default expect colocation to become a more frequent term. As in we started remote and colocated after our Series A . He's absolutely right about the benefits of face to face. The question is whether the costs exceed the benefits in 2020 in the Bay Area specifically and then more generally. Maybe the new convention is that you start remote and partially colocate at your Series A. Remote first is now the default. It's the cheapest fastest and most flexible. An office is still valuable but it's a premium upgrade. Good discussion. There's still benefit to colocation because remote doesn't capture every aspect of collaboration and VR isn't at scale yet. But 1 Important open source projects have been fully remote for a while 2 And colocation need not mean colocating in SF CA USA Great video by on Tuft Prof Michael Levin’s research. Bioelectricity hasn’t received that much popular attention but there’s quite a lot of experimental evidence in amphibians in particular that shows how important it is. Full video here It may be possible to regenerate human limbs. Indeed The current model is very paperwork intensive up front but then doesn’t enforce any ongoing security guarantees. A crypto model might be interesting. and Oasis are working on this. A billion genomes. With homomorphic encryption secure multiparty computation or the like to permit privacy preserving decentralized studies outside academia. Opt in to studies with one click become participant rather than patient share to see your results. We’ll get there. gt startups have not been a meaningful durable constraint on industry practices many stakeholders dislike Substack Bitcoin Ethereum Signal Stripe These are off the top of my head may need long form to discuss further. I guess we’d have to define terms. Are you saying startups don’t take significant market share that the big five will still be as dominant in ten years or what? COVID in the US won’t be done for a while because a chunk of the population won’t take a vaccine. Moreover this is an extinction event for local businesses. And so much else. It won’t just pop back up. It’ll be very different afterwards. Two other magnets that brought people to the Bay Area are also being virtualized. 1 Investing continues to move online with AngelList rolling funds Zoom VC and the resurgence of crypto. 2 And Stanford Berkeley are moving to remote instruction for at least a year. This is healthy overall. Many in SF wanted tech gone. They are getting their wish. Tech in turn is finally fully decentralizing and cutting the last obligate ties to the land. Making everything remote means tech can be anywhere. And build startup cities in the middle of nowhere. San Francisco as the de facto capital of tech is done. That time and place is over. There’s no point in moving there for tech the businesses are shut down and people aren’t meeting up. It’s all internet now for a while. And relocation to towns and cities around the world. 1000 startups are collectively very formidable competition. Instagram Snapchat Oculus WhatsApp TikTok were all startups. Individually any one may fail but together they force either an acquisition thus funding more startups or reform disruption. But it’s actually really hard to get acquired. For every one you read about there are N that didn’t make it. And it is those acquisitions in nontrivial part that fuel the competition as they fill the coffers of investors and founders and encourage more competitors. I actually agree with many of the criticisms regarding privacy and centralization of power but we’ve seen what state regulation looks like. It looks like GDPR. It’s not competent or surgical or effective. Startups amp crypto protocols are a different approach to reform. This is probably the core philosophical difference. We think of startups as the ultimate form of constructive criticism and of tech giants as vulnerable. We also think the state is not competent see SF CA US . Reform is welcome regulation just strengthens incumbents. We’re getting closer to high fidelity VR. Putting something on chain is a stronger version of putting it online. You blunt the impact of link rot stealth editing downtime format obsolescence firewalls and many related issues. That will likely be accomplished via following mechanisms. Anyone can invest on their own or invest in funds investors with proven track records. The latter is similar to Twitter following. Important thread. It is a bit of a delayed reaction but the age of international American media dominance is coming to a close. Part of this is because the US is now just less aspirational to people abroad. We will see more media in local languages and cultures. Crypto also changes the feedback loops for investing from 10 years to essentially real time. This has downsides but it will mean every portfolio is always liquid and marked to market. That’s important for bringing even more capital into the space. Founders amp funders are a two sided market. An influx on one side is accompanied by a rise in economic leverage for the other side and then a corresponding influx into that side and so on. More investors higher valuations more founders more competition lower valuations. It’s easier to fund than to found. Though not easy to do well. All the talk about capital abundance will be more viscerally understood as the number of investors rises. Eventually we get a billion crypto investors. And we all see the extent to which progress is founder limited. We need to once again lean into the radically egalitarian nature of the original internet. All nodes are created equal. There is someone in India Nigeria Venezuela who is a better investor than most of the folks on Sand Hill or Wall Street. Crypto gives them the chance to rise. Technologically you could build the Coinbase Twitter mashup today in which every user does casual pseudonymous microinvesting and tracks their progress on a public leaderboard. It may take a generation for crypto people to fill the relevant regulatory and policy roles though. We will have a billion VCs by 2040. Just like the internet turned everyone into publishers crypto will turn everyone into investors. We’re now developing many societal alternatives to college as we know it. Before college? startup gap year During college? online ed After college or instead of college? ISAs These kinds of reforms will persist even after the pandemic abates. GPT 3 shows that chatbots were a good idea just a few years too early. GPT 3 should update your mental model here. Take a look at the various demos based on it. Once all work is remote work then every interaction with a coworker is over an internet connection. So an AI can drop right in there alongside everyone else. Slack bots and scheduling AIs like Clara are v1 of this. What’s v2? If you watch a lecturer writing math seeing them actually write it out gives you insight into the order of operations in their head. Even if you don’t see it written in real time a diagram often reduces a graph to its absolute essentials. You can reproduce it from memory. People may be averse to winning against totally fake bots though video games like World of Warcraft argue otherwise . But AI judges would change that dynamic. They’d grade your posts like Simon Cowell amp give you feedback. Might even help produce useful code and writing. I wonder if you reposition this as AI judges. So the algorithm is now transparent. This judge gives you a public upvote based on feature X you posted at the right time . And this other one gives a public upvote based on feature Y your post has an interesting visual . It’s already here. You could also imagine this in reverse. A social network where every comment is filtered for whether an AI could have produced it. If it’s a low context low signal reply especially if negative it’s filtered out. A reverse Turing Test for humans. The bar rises over time The Botnet app is a really interesting concept. Turing capable NPCs may be a way to break the gamification of social networks and restore a more Dunbar number like world. Everyone a king so no one is? I wonder how immersive one could make the illusion. Full Westworld. Give those NPCs phone numbers and emails too. Make them respond with voice and text like humans. We have trillions of social media posts as training data. You don’t see most people in person anymore anyway We have algorithmic feeds on TikTok AI influencers on Instagram and first class bots on Telegram. But we haven’t seen a social network that leans into all of this and just populates the whole thing with hyperrealistic NPCs. Video games have done this though. MMT isn’t logical on its face. It does have a higher logic though which is that it represents the unlimited government. Like BTC ppl the MMT folks correctly apprehend that money printing is the core of state power. They take this in a very different direction though gt were more severe We don’t have the counterfactual the parallel economy. The common take in crypto is that gold BTC economies have more corrections but not Great Depressions. Trying to iron all of the volatility out of the system by fiat sets you up for a gigantic crash. The fundamental critique we have of macro is that it’s been hard to run controlled experiments. Outside of capitalism vs communism at least. Crypto completely changes that. It allows opt in economies with real money and new policies. Finally some alternatives and experiments. Well I am glad we can run the experiment. The mainstream view is that moderate inflation is good as it spurs consumption and escapes liquidity traps. The crypto view is that hyperdeflation is good that it incentivizes saving and reflects real progress in reduction of prices. He is expected to outline what could be the central bank’s most active efforts ever to spur inflation It will work in some domains first better than others. Probably text to images. Search implies the thing you’re looking for must already exist. Generation implies only that you must be able to imagine it. What if search is replaced with procedural generation? As in type in what you actually want and it generates the whole thing for you. The big breakthrough may be when this is bundled with Tweetdeck style software. It’s not just bots anymore. It’s normal users using this to pump up the likes for their posts. AI suggested content. More dopamine superstimulus. Whole thing may become even more kaleidoscopic. AI may eventually break social networks. Algorithms churn out beautiful Instagram scenes that few humans can match. In response networks may adopt crypto verification. Or people may just scale back to the Dunbar number of folks they know in person. Btw what this suggests is that a city state populated from the cloud and underpinned by a crypto REIT in which every resident was a shareholder would do extremely well. Interesting. That’s a take on the Eastern Roman Empire I hadn’t heard before. Yes Invision Wordpress Gitlab are three that come to mind. Many more nowadays. Many have observed this but a lot of the conversation around SF or NY is between folks who think of these cities as mainly a base of operations vs those who think of them as part of their identity. The former make coolly dispassionate analyses that make the latter heated. Some people get all nationalistic about their cities. Others about their countries. Still others about their companies. And yet others about their cryptocurrencies. It would be funny if someone cited this graph for why NYC will come back. Rome also came back It just took 1000 years and it wasn’t the capital of a global empire anymore. By the way haven’t seen anyone connect decentralized finance with New York’s decline. But it’s another major factor. The global financial capital is moving onto the Internet now. Note SF is also declining as are many major US cities. Urbanization is in retreat. Twitter is remote and produces more serendipitous meetings than many large cities. This is by way of saying that I think Seinfeld is wrong here about whether NYC will fully bounce back. It’s interesting that he brings up London and Rome as examples. They were once the most important cities of globe spanning empires. Now they are not. There are downsides to remote but there are also huge upsides especially around cost convenience and commute. In person is still valuable but now it’s a premium good. We’re in a remote default world now. Yeah. It’s just an interesting question I think to revisit all these older protocols with new crypto tools and ask if we can do something better. For example staking rather than SPF DKIM for email reputation. Machine translation may get really good this decade. Imagine a step function similar to GPT 3 or the recent rise in remote work. The latter was catalyzed by corona but the tools also needed to be there. Right. Neither China nor the current USA but the Decentralized Networks of the Internet as the globally dominant power of the 21st century. It’s both as obvious and non obvious as the rise of the USA was in 1914. This is one thesis at least. The rise of the Liminal Anglosphere is particularly interesting. India Nigeria Israel Singapore the Philippines and English speakers around the world now outnumber the Anglosphere of the US Canada Australia New Zealand. And the latter did envelop and succeed the UK. From the United States of America to the Decentralized Networks of the Internet. Most haven’t yet thought about cross network peering arrangements as being similar to interstate compacts. But there are many analogies particularly for crypto networks. The Internet will be to America what America was to Europe. A frontier that ultimately succeeds its progenitor. It’s not a common suffix unlike .com Here’s his followup from 2017. Remember when put his life savings into Bitcoin at a blended price of less than 10 BTC in 2011? People mocked him for years. He’s now up gt 1000X. Bitcoin is strong. Strong enough to shrug off countless attacks while in its infancy. Strong enough to ascend the commanding heights of finance in its adolescence. Strong enough to become the center of the entire system as it rises to adulthood. How to make crypto domains resolve in browsers prior to general support? If issuing then get or the gTLD for .xyz or both. And redirect. Right now .eth uses for this purpose. But that is less intuitive. TMI too much information This is used in a joking way when you learn something about someone that you didn’t want to know. But it applies more broadly to all the personal info on the internet. We can start using crypto domain names as pseudonyms to start rebuilding boundaries. We are entering the real future. VR is so much more convenient for graduates all around the country or all around the world. Incredible graph. Fits data from other sources. Sell city buy country. Before corona. First part holds up well. Now for the second The wisdom of crowds seems to apply in some cases. You can survey people to estimate the number of jellybeans in a jar. But you can’t survey them to estimate the gravitational constant. It’s too far beyond people’s daily experience. Something we take for granted is that when executives inside a company have a disagreement they don’t typically take it to Twitter to polarize the customer base into opposing factions. There are often more productive and positive sum ways to settle a dispute. When does involving the general public improve a decision? It can be helpful when gauging market demand or popularity. Issues that impact the public’s buying decisions. But it’s not useful for determining say the composition of an alloy. Basically over the last thirty years we bulk imported the real world into the internet. But the physics are different here. And laws rules and norms haven’t adapted. We need to re establish all of that. Thesis we are in an intermediate era where you can easily google strangers and find out what they look like. What’s coming is a hall of mirrors of AI avatars and virtual reality. On the other side by 2050 or so you may not know what distant people look like anymore. Worth distinguishing between pseudonymity vs anonymity though. Pseudonymity is Reddit anonymity is 4chan. The latter is a den of iniquity. The former can be civil. On balance I think it’s a more stable internet if everyone is default pseudonymous. I think it takes 10 20 yrs. Bruno is one of a few people in the world of letters who gets what decentralized truth really means. Argument from cryptography defeats argument from authority over the next 10 20 years. The network as the next Leviathan. Btw graph at the top is from Eran Segal’s group. Future historians may note that this was the era of sugar caffeine opioids and social media. Just like previous eras were in part driven by nicotine and alcohol. Maybe there’s always a dominant drug of the age even if we don’t see it. We have physiological data that shows the effect of nutritional diet on metabolism. You can see the glucose spike after a cookie. Do we have graphs that show the effect of information diet on neurology? Can we see the dopamine spike after a tweet? Body language is interesting. It’s not typed out and people often don’t even know they’re doing it or reacting to it. VR may start to get us here. There is research on transmitting facial expressions too. Yes there is something about context busting and scale. But there are also many large accounts who are constantly angry. You may be onto something. If you showed the number of friends or values in common in the reply UX would that change behavior? For some people it was once novel to be able to yell at random strangers online. But it’s much less novel in 2020. Indeed it’s the default state of affairs thanks to likes and upvotes. And so online insanity has created a demand for online and offline civility. I used to wonder why people were so much ruder on Twitter than real life. Then 2020 happened and Twitter became real life. Now I think we’ll need a new social network that models physical world levels of civility. Rebuild civilization online first then offline. India is the dark horse of this decade. Increasingly using DuckDuckGo for search. Privacy preserving less thumb on the scale. There was a time when Google was magical. It would nail these queries for really arcane technical topics. Can’t remember the last time it felt like that. Hard to find old content for example. We’re not that far off if you think about Unity and the state of game engines. And people are logging into Oculus Quest with their Facebook accounts. The procedural content generation part is still hard though. Maybe GPT 3 and sequels can move us beyond branching dialogue? The programmatic protagonist a movie where you are the hero and the screenplay is auto generated from content you’ve liked. Moral principles have no logical limits. Only pragmatic ones. By 202X it’s all AI avatars and crypto pseudonyms. Real name considered harmful. Public blockchains aren’t just open source they’re open state amp open execution. A glass box where you can trace every read amp write made by every algorithm. They provide a new way to design internet services without relying upon centralized corporations. This piece is better than most in that it engages with the tech but misses the point. A public blockchain is a massively multiclient database where every user is a root user. As opposed to a few privileged sysadmins at a social network or bank. Right now seems like we have a few options 1 Write your own chain from scratch 2 Write a new client like btcd or parity and add non consensus breaking features 3 Fork an existing chain 4 Do a smart contract on an existing chain 5 Use a framework like Cosmos What else? That was where I started too. Systems programming is hard real money security harder. But with so many new protocols being developed there are some common features. Cosmos has tried abstracting out many pieces. Maybe it’s the first blockchain framework but not the last. Well crypto has arguably made it easier to start a digital bank than a lemonade stand. There are also gradations a smart contract isn’t a full protocol like Ethereum but it’s not a conventional CRUD app either. And web dev used to mean much lower level programming. Oh I know. But many of these protocols were developed before modern systems programming languages and frameworks. Could you reimplement them with far fewer LOC using well chosen abstractions? We do have reference implementations to check against. Sort of. Cosmos’ SDK is closer to what I was thinking of. But ideally it would be a framework that uses the same abstractions to let you code both older protocols NTP SMTP etc and newer crypto protocols with native performance unit tests etc. Cosmos is a good step towards this. But can we do more? A protocol typically can’t tolerate the same amount of overhead as a web app so it wouldn’t be the same approach as in most web frameworks. Maybe something in Rust and or involving code generation. How can we make protocol development as easy as web development? Folks this is my friend Max Hodak President of Neuralink which is building actual brain machine interfaces. Cofounder is a lil’ guy called Elon Musk. If you are a citizen journalist with a tech background who can sling around an equation reply to Max to see if you’re a fit. At some price most markets clear. Moreover you can at your discretion import reputation from other systems. I have some posts on zero knowledge transfer of karma between HD wallet accounts. Look at ENS names. All the infrastructure for portable reputation is finally being created and will likely get built out during the rise of DeFi. Crypto allows for capitalism without corporations. So it dramatically changes the balance of power. I think that Uber had to be centralized to iterate amp nail the frontend the consumer experience. But once the frontend has stabilized for a few years then a product is ripe for decentralization. The v1 open version should keep the frontend constant and just change the backend. With rising nationalism amp socialism the only way to build an international tech company by 2030 may be to not build a tech company at all. Build it protocol first and share the wealth with users. Make it widely popular hard to ban open source amp algorithmically transparent. All the Uber but on the blockchain pitches from a few years ago will eventually happen. They were just too early. By protocolizing these platforms we address concerns about both state and corporate power at the same time.  The intersection is that both wow and cool types are leaders. They draw people in. But they do so in different ways. Wow is often focused on the natural world computers medicine. Cool is focused on other humans and their psychology. You might add a third category which is cozy or comfy. The drive and cover shot and kick would be cool. The food and coffee cool if done by a chef and cozy if done at home. The two concepts are actually fairly different. And while both are valued by society if you are 100 wow you probably fairly uncool and if you are 100 focused on being cool you will probably never do something wow. Wow is rocket ships limb regeneration autonomous robots GPT 3 magnetic levitation unidentified flying objects awesome in the original sense. Cool is velvet ropes fashionable clothes celebrity the pop of flash photography the craning neck the adulation of the crowd. Ah this is awesome. Hadn’t seen that looks like feature went live a few months ago. Otter does integrate with Zoom now so you can get live transcripts. No such thing as a neutral platform anymore. It’s either a neutral protocol or an opinionated platform. So lean into the opinionated part. You won’t appeal to everyone but you will appeal to some. And then expand from there. 2010s user generated content 2020s founder generated content? Gmail’s personalized smart replies is like v1 of this. A GPT 3 sequel trained on your corpus would be v2. And then? An AI standin that can give anyone at anytime a reasonable cheap answer from you at low cost. And then kick it up to the human if it’s too complex. Once a job is reduced to hitting keys and watching a screen for feedback it’s now doable in principle by a sufficiently sophisticated AI. We may all be able to continuously train our replacements. But they may be AI avatars of ourselves. You might be able to scale yourself. Remote work is recordable indexable searchable automatable work. Some meetings should be off the record of course. But it’s true that as ALL work goes on screen you can start indexing in novel ways. For example I’m surprised no one has integrated something like with Zoom. Automatic meeting minutes in a GDoc. This has a decent overview of how price signals help create decentralized order. Capitalists in the decentralized Hayekian order sense are pretty different from capitalists in the let’s make a lot of money sense. Unrequited hate when someone posts constantly about a person that never thinks about them at all. Ha. From November 2019. You’ve read that physical restaurants are over. And they may be. But virtual restaurants are about to go vertical. Investing in amazing people in Nigeria India Israel and all around the world This is pretty cool. A library of old books on technology to at least get you to 1800s 1900s levels. Why was physics the biggest thing in the early 20th century while computer science is so important today? Because we spend so much time in artificial constructed realities. But when you innovate in the physical world like with drones or sequencing you need physics again. Monopsony monopoly buyer Well I think content marketing has shown one model for free content. Arguably so has open source in the form of GitHub tutorials and coding blog posts. We’ll see but I am optimistic on paid Discord Locals Slack as a way to monetize community while leaving content free. robotic and autarkic rhyme at the end autarkic and farm rhyme in the middle Hence euphonious. Or somewhat so Status is well done from everything I can see. Been tracking it for a while. Will put it through the paces. Yes. And there’s also vote with your feet. Combinations are particularly interesting as in the concept of crowdchoice. It would be all about estimated community size x persistence x monetization capability. A different model that incentivizes educational quality evergreen content over evanescent infotainment. May be more profitable in the long run. The will of the people Let the market decide Similar concepts Different advocates Agree. And I know that’s why you have multiple CC licenses. Twitter has space constraints but in order to address issue of how does professional content get funded the community monetization model is I think going to be powerful. And incentivizes more CC content. Ah. Monetizing the community may mean charging on per user basis for access to a Discord Locals Slack or something similar. Or it could be something more sophisticated like job boards. But the idea is that free content attracts community. And monetization is then win win. The decentralized social network Get some ETH Buy an ENS address Upload a profile photo Get a profile page hosted on IPFS Now you’re on chain. stored on IPFS with IPFS URL in turn stored in an ENS custom text record your ETH pays for the IPFS pinning You could probably seed it with 100 repos using existing Creative Commons Project Gutenberg and open data sets movies audio to get some variety. Then figure out common user stories and turn into commands. Packed is bad no? Creator is canonical host of content and community moderator. People pay to access civil moderated ideologically aligned community. Yeah thinking about a toolchain similar to cargo or pip or npm but for pulling and manipulating media files rather than source code. Data analysts and people at places like ILM already do this kind of thing joint version control of text amp large binary data . Not yet everyone. It’s easy to create new git subcommands and make them behave natively. So you could progressively build up a suite of tools for pulling amp manipulating files from a set of decentralized media repos. Which may become something like pip and pypi. What would git pull look like for decentralized media? One big thing would be the use of git lfs or some equivalent for version controlling audio and video binaries. But you may also want content aware subcommands like git mp4 to extract frames. The first billion is the hardest. Imagine if you could pull any frame from any movie or any text from any article as easily as you might git pull open source software. Creative Commons Common Crawl open access in science social media Sci Hub IPFS dweb and crypto are all steps forward here. Would love to hear about your experience in more detail if you want to write a post. Well the pandemic is not a one day event like 9 11 it’s an ongoing driving force. I do think cities in other countries that have handled corona will mostly get through this. But I am bearish on US cities in general. Specifically imagine a parallel decentralized media ecosystem for movies music books news. All content would be fully open source amp free by default available in git repos for any use from memes to machine learning. Creators monetize by charging for access to the community. Creative Commons is like copyleft for content. It’s done well with 1B uses but it may still be underutilized. I’ve been thinking for some time that you might use it as the basis of a new open source media ecosystem where all content was free and you monetized the community. Yeah. We have to get to a situation where corrections are more like routine bug reports than big todos where everyone gets in a tizzy about it. If it’s the first draft of history should be treated as such Would love to see a video if you want to take one. May RT if you can include date and location when you post it. As a meta observation this is a good example of a piece of content where the ledger of record would help. You could look up timestamp uploader content hash and possibly location if we can get reliable proofs. Starts to give unambiguous who what when. This video is reported to be from the period after the unrest of early June. It would be good to see a timelapse of this amp other cities. There has been some coverage of the NYC exodus and retail apocalypse but visuals are lacking. I don’t think the city will easily bounce back. Yes crypto will be big here But pseudonymous VR boxing for charity may be a different complementary way to disincentivize casual attacks and solve the same problem of dispute resolution without bloodshed or even physical contact. Now that I think about it getting a cut of the karma breaks the illusion of social media. It makes it too obvious that it's often a game played for likes rather than a communications modality. But a cut of the crypto is always valuable. Collaboration is more natural The issue that arises is then about incentives. But a new kind of social network that allowed for collaborative accumulation of karma or crypto might solve that. Gives an incentive for allowing select? others to use your name in an anonymizing ring. Agree. The part that breaks down here is the incentive for those 99 to remain silent. But perhaps with a new social network they might get a cut of the karma or upvotes or ad revenue in return for letting their public key be used. Need to think through incentive structures. Agree. The part that breaks down here is the incentive for those 99 to remain silent. But perhaps with a new social network they might get a cut of the karma or upvotes or ad revenue in return for letting their public key be used. Need to think through incentive structures. You can do this with crypto addresses in various ways. The cleanest might be to bind a public key to an ENS name like yourname.eth and then do a lookup as follows. The crypto way of doing this is with ring signatures. Actually you might be able to implement this today if N people put their ENS domain names on their Twitter profiles as ENS has a public key lookup method. Yes. The crypto way of doing this is with ring signatures. Everyone would have their public key posted. You pick say 99 other public keys and use your private key to sign a message. All anyone knows is that it was posted by one of 100 people. This is doable right now btw. When you compare this video to the snarky coverage out there it's like night and day. For example Jake discusses cruise ships special economic zones and other at scale proof points to show feasibility. Shows the need for decentralized media. Great video by on seasteading with 130k views I do think it'll be easier to do cloud to land cities first where you build the community online crowdfund land and then migrate offline. But this is a smart summary of the ideas. The best way to test the hypothesis that tech was responsible for what went wrong in SF is a controlled experiment. Take a city built from scratch by tech in the middle of nowhere and compare it to the city of SF without tech. See which one produces immigrants. And emigrants. Here's a previous piece from 2013 which goes into more depth though there are new ideas since then . The v1 is just Facetime. The v2 would be a more immersive way of coordination. Hands free streaming on the hands side less need for verbalization from the cloud side. Action at a distance The complement to remote work will be remote hands. People you can hire to be your remote eyes ears and hands from thousands of miles away or down the street. We already do this in datacenters soon it will be everywhere. See also this thread. Tools for simulating buildings in VR prior to materializing them are currently the province of professionals. Only a matter of time before they become building blocks for new intentional social networks. A cloud community that intends to shape the land. It’s easier to start a new town than to reform San Francisco. Build a digital community of hundreds of thousands of people. Simulate the architecture in VR. Do a dry run of governance and culture online. Then crowdfund land and build it from scratch. This argument due in part to and in part to some thinking on the modern surveillance state. Counterargument We are actually in a transitional era where this is not the case. We don’t have Google Maps Streetview for spacetime. We can’t replay every event from all angles. It’s still selective due to reasonable privacy concerns. True full context would change things. Boxr like Twitter but anyone can challenge you to a VR boxing match if you insult them. Figure out fair matchups by age weight gender etc. If demographics don’t match up they fight one of your followers in their weight class and vice versa. Just insane enough to try I get it. But given that most of the folks fighting on social media will never meet in real life VR is the next best thing. The humane alternative to a duel. Actually does mean staying physically fit in order to win internet points for example. Disincentivize casual insults. Would be even better for politics. All these folks want to do is punch each other’s lights out anyway. The Canadians have actually already descended into barbarism. They can show us how it’s done. Below is their traditional protocol for leader selection. Yes this is mostly a joke but as VR headset adoption grows I’d love to see someone try this. Can you imagine some of the long running Twitter feuds turning into VR charity boxing matches? People might crowdfund the headsets. Proceeds to charity. VR boxing is getting pretty good. I do wonder if the next generation brings back online dueling. It’s the workout and the thrill of victory agony of defeat before a crowd but without the brain damage. One click Charlie Murphy I challenge you to a duel? May want multiple pseuds crypto domain names for different purposes. And you might also encrypt on chain txs such that they are only viewable by certain parties. BTC ETH allow everyone to view shielded ZEC allows no one next level may be to selectively allow someone. A major advantage of this approach is that you can view the reputation attached to your account. In the event that it’s wrong you can add a note. Or in the worst case start afresh from a new account should the old one be unfairly tarnished by some Equifax like corporate error. An Ethereum account tied to a crypto domain name is one way to solve this. For any app you type in yourname.eth amp get a login confirmation in your wallet. All metadata attached to yourname.eth is then pulled into app including reputation. A network effect around ETH accounts? In other words digitally constrained supply causes the long term price to rocket. We go to the moon not because it is easy to mine Bitcoin but because it is hard. Yes. Crypto quantifies the strength of a community. Intensity of belief of net worth in the asset multiplied by number of people over the number of years of locked coins. The concept here is that every SaaS tool gives its users some skill. So what if the internal currency of the community that all users accepted for paid tasks was also the company’s token or coin? Of course users may also take safe BTC ETH in lieu of speculative tokens. Come for the tool pay for the network? Perhaps the future of SaaS isn’t just open source but open state amp open execution. Make the tool free host it on a crypto backend and charge for coin and community. For example pay coins to the crypto Photoshop community to do tasks. VR makes the analogy between a domain name and a plot of land more than a metaphor. So does AR in reverse the digital domain adds value to the physical land. And crypto domains take this to the next level by giving a piece of digital real estate that can’t be seized. How does the cloud free the land? People form groups in the cloud and move to areas on the land where they can build freely. The sovereign collective. A domain name is like a bare plot of land. While you can build a billion dollar business at a domain name you need a billion permits to build a shed in the physical world. That pushed innovation into the cloud. But perhaps the cloud eventually frees the land. That’s because tech is about the frontier. The physical frontier closed in 1890. A centralized century followed. Then the digital frontier reopened in 1991 once NSF legalized commerce on the internet. Here’s a lecture from early 2013 on this topic In this scenario SF is first only because it’s the worst. But exodus from other cities follows as the pandemic continues for years. Prior to COVID I’d been tracking the feasibility of the autarkic robotic farm. Could people live off the land once again? Scenario the pandemic rages for years and urban exodus accelerates. The future is going solo on wide open plains. The digital frontier reopens the physical frontier. Remote work and Starlink reopens much of the map. Communes in the middle of nowhere once again become possible. Apple is sitting on piles of cash amp analytics. They can easily find amp fund the best apps in their ecosystem. It does trade off dependable App Store fees for volatile stock but a portfolio smooths it. And they’ve done large strategics before like Didi The win win move may be for Apple to take a stake in the most successful companies in the App Store in return for discounting their fees. The prospect of going from 30 to 0 would be such a lift to the stock price of these companies that it might pay Apple back immediately. Bitcoin forks don’t fork the backlinks from wallets exchanges miners block explorers and the like. That backlink structure has to be built anew for each fork which is why they aren’t dilutive in the same way that issuing more BTC would be. That said if you’re debating folks who agree the dollar is inflating away its value but are still bullish on gold I wouldn’t lead with the scarcity argument per se valid as it may be . I’d lead with the fact that physical gold has counterparty risk amp is hard to transport. Yes agree. Space constraints that’s why I wrote helped I’m not a specialist in the period but Hackett linked book argues that the flood of silver and gold was a major factor in inflation but not the trigger and not the only factor. 1 It’s true that Bitcoin is digitally scarce in a way that gold isn’t. 2 Gold from the Americas did flood Europe in the 1500s which helped cause inflation. 3 Asteroid mining sounds crazy but may produce gold in a similar way. There is a possible future in which the combination of nationalist and socialist policies by the US and other countries seriously harm the big five tech cos. and then it all goes crypto. So you can still scale internationally to billions but it has to be an open protocol. The Survivor Library is gathering essential knowledge that would be necessary to jump start modern civilization should it fail past the point where a simple 'reboot' is possible. If humanity suffers a cataclysm nuclear war runaway global warming or any of a number of other potential catastrophes a lot of scientific knowledge could be lost especially the practical ‘how to’ kind. If I left you in the woods with a hatchet how long before you could send me an email? Think of this as a visual companion to 's book The Knowledge. You probably couldn't do this in the city but lots of people have recently moved out to the countryside so This I want to see. A small group should do this for real and film instructional videos along the way. 0 to civilization in how many hours? Btw that dex article was by . I always keep my eye out for folks writing strong informative numerically grounded work. His recent body of work is a good overview of defi if you want to get up to speed. After years of development dexes are finally starting to move real volume. Looks like they're collectively at 10 of Binance in 24 hours 420M vs 4B . The full selection of tokens coins isn't there yet but it should hopefully get there over time. Where we're going we won't need centralization. PSA I am always available to help you with your studies and career if you’re a young engineer well so much as time and ability permit but I do think it’s our responsibility to help the next generation Every name becomes a domain name Or at least a URL In a sense this is just a reboot of the original RDF vision where every resource had a URI. But crypto domain names allow the necessary innovation at DNS level to revisit many of these ideas. Blockusign You can literally sign a contract using crypto domain names. The date typed out name and signature field would be replaced by the timestamp typed out crypto domain name and on chain digital signatures of each party. ENS has custom record types. So you could define an ERC20 record just like a TXT or CNAME and put the corresponding contract address there. Maybe or has other ideas though. If crypto is programmable money crypto domain names are programmable names. A decentralized alternative to fiat money a decentralized alternative to fiat names. Yeah. And all that is great But it has to work natively without a plugin or slash or else you type it in and get a confusing 404. I know Opera is already there. Means a working with browsers to add support and b maybe showing a demo social network that uses these features. Yeah that’s interesting. Maybe crypto domain reputation is part of how people make crypto ISAs amp personal tokens work. As well as other forms of verification is this a bot spam account? Also allows people to start from scratch with a new name. Yeah. It’s interesting because it also hacks the highly visible name field as a form of export. Key to making this work is resolving crypto domain names in Chrome or some workaround for this . And they’re programmable names you don’t need white pages people search engines or other lookup tables as much because the contact info and name are the same you can transfer karma between crypto domains held in the same HD wallet see below Using crypto domain names in place of real names has more advantages you can attach metadata in the form of TXT records you can send receive encrypted data directly to the name not just messages you can verify identity via domain metadata signing and or staking It solves like 10 different problems. For example name squatting goes away. You would now need to validate DNS or ENS etc to get your username on each service. But then you reliably get the same brand everywhere rather than having on one service and on another. If we use crypto domains in place of real names usernames everywhere that obviates questions like what’s your username email or how do I pay you . Because it’s now obvious. Same unique username on every service. Send an encrypted message or payment to that domain. Yes exactly. I knew all this but the switch flipped for me the other day when I combined this with my pseudonymous economy talk. What you want from someone on the internet is JUST their domain name. Not their their real name which is their state name or social security name. If you get someone’s crypto domain name you can find them on the internet pay them and send them an encrypted message while knowing only what they choose to share. Globally unique amp useful while also being totally pseudonymous. To say the least state names can’t do this. Imagine a social network which only allowed you to sign up with a valid crypto domain name. Now imagine you didn’t need to sign up at all. Just flip a switch to make your data accessible so the service can read amp write to a subset of your domain. Like . With decentralized DNS like and more it starts to get interesting to think about domain names as being the default for decentralized media. A crypto domain collapses names usernames discovery payment profiles amp encryption into one thing. If you read Seeing Like a State there’s a sense in which the term real name is a misnomer. A better term is a state name a name which makes you legible to the state. By analogy a domain name is a network name. A name which makes you legible to the network. Domain name gt real name A domain name may be the most useful type of pseudonym. It pulls up your site as the first hit when punched into a browser indeed it bypasses search altogether. It’s also globally unique programmable persistent and cross culturally understood. Personally though I am partial to crypto civilization. Real crypto anarchy has never been tried. You might think that California running out of money a few months into a multiyear pandemic signals doom. That the state might not be able to pay its bills that it’s a touch and go situation. But my friend you underestimate the American spirit We have not yet begun to print. Never back down from a necessary fight but always think about how to make the fight unnecessary. Fun roundup of some of the ideas I’ve put out there. Always interesting to see how tweets ricochet around the world. Though I should put it down in long form as otherwise some of it gets lost in translation. Examples Address climate with fusion Stop surveillance with encryption Reduce traffic with micromobility Control COVID with testing This is the technological progressive worldview. Social problems exist amp we should go after them. Start with what you can do as an individual. Good conversation on ideas for realigning tech media and the broader society. I do believe part of the long run solution is making media millionaires. If you create content that inspires people to solve social problems with technology fund your followers amp get a fair share. Also a good one. Like reproducible research. Good one. Kind of like zero knowledge. You might call this meta knowledge proofs. to that data is routed through a server you control. This doesn’t solve the problem of caching decrypted content though. But that may be tolerable if after deletion update it can no longer be cryptographically proved that said decrypted content came from the author. The next question is how to get host nodes in the network to enforce a decentralized update delete. How do you make it such that data was readable by some and now it’s not? Maybe something like forward secrecy or Kerberos tickets can be used here. Or perhaps all read access There are different models. There's the current create read only of blockchains and IPFS. Or the server can do anything model of most cloud services. But there may be an intermediate where only a user with their own private key can update delete their own records. One thing such a bridge would instantly make clear is that your budget for college doesn't budget for maintenance. How do you know your skills aren't out of date? People like have been working on this problem amp have some amazing results. The fiat currency to cryptocurrency bridge was more important than many expected. And still has a lot of legs. I think other fiat to crypto bridges may also be a big deal over time. Like the fiat identity to cryptoidentity bridge. Portable cross platform attestation of skills? I think pseudonymity actually helps rebuild trust as it prevents both discrimination and cancellation. Long form version in talk below. The next step after remote work is pseudonymous work. Once all work can be done through an internet connection people don't need to know your official name. And Square and are pioneers here once again. Yes they're the closest. But are more like infotainment than edutainment. Do you typically have a new skill at the end of a documentary? Maybe you know a bit more about a historical period. But still you're not sure whether they had scrupulous adherence to the facts. He's basically saying the same thing as you. He's saying that individuals are easier to diligence than opaque institutions. Now that I see all the news that isn’t fit to print I wonder Why’d you leave that out? Why’d you choose that headline? What else is being censored? I don’t trust the masthead. I don’t even trust the journalists…I seek out subjects directly on Twitter. Yeah. But Netflix is too focused on eating up time. I think it'd have to be a new platform like with an incentive for learning something quickly amp well. Edutainment gt infotainment in terms of both short term cost requires focus amp long term benefit builds skill Exams show this is at least somewhat doable for a wide class of skills. Peer review as per LinkedIn Skills would expand scope further. Satoshi's huge innovation was solving the problem of consensus in an adversarial environment. It's insanely broad in its applicability as it can be applied beyond BTC to figure out who did what when for every transaction and every assertion. The blockchain as digital history. This is related to other consensus algorithms and the general concept of convergence in math. How many timesteps before consensus? How many terms in a series before convergence? And will we achieve consensus convergence all? There's a tradeoff between truth and time Yes. Satoshi quantified this in the Bitcoin whitepaper through the concept of the number of independent confirmations. How much time to wait before we can reliably estimate the true state of the blockchain? Side note Google appears to have rolled out a modification to search. They use direct links to text fragments which modify the URL amp are highlighted on the page in yellow as above. There's a Chrome extension for this though it appears built in to search. I've thought about this for a while in the context of doing more with placement testing. You can self administer a placement test on a topic say convex optimization to see what details are still in working memory. And see where to brush up. DRAM refresh for the brain? Proof of memory Brilliant concept by the inimitable . His metric would show how many downloads of an idea into people's brains had actually occurred. It's like a way to track active installs for ideas. That's super cool. In some cases N proofs of memory can be aggregated into a single proof of skill. Like a recent score on a history exam demonstrates working knowledge of a particular time period. Twitter has space constraints but a digital signature does show that either 1 someone got your private key to sign the message 2 someone managed to break the cryptographic scheme 3 someone guessed the correct signature by luck The last is vanishingly improbable. Yeah you could do that with an NFT signed by say Lambda School or where they assert that you had a particular skill at a particular time in their assessment. cc A thread on the ledger of record for context. Worth compiling a list of proof of Xs. For example proof of who digital signature proof of what cryptographic hash proof of when blockchain timestamp There's also proof of location proof of space etc. Each such proof expands the scope of the ledger of record. Got more? Well I think we'll find that without digital history without a cryptographically verified record of who asserted what when that society falls apart completely. an assertion is not itself a fact but crypto does allow probabilistic truth for the metadata who what when Well BTC works because its timestamps aren't falsifiable. And totalitarian regimes have always been interested in falsifying history. A blockchain is already a digital history of who did what when. And with proof of location identity etc we may be able to expand scope. Great thread on how many fans appreciated more in depth educational commentary on sports. Learning while being entertained. This is related to something else I've often thought about. Every genre of movie exists in Hollywood comedy drama horror other than education. gt Is it really such an issue to trust a centralized provider for the timestamp Yes. The precise timeline of what happened when is often exactly what's in dispute. Here's a thread with 3 examples of timestamps resolving issues Tesla Brazil China . I get where you're coming from but here's what I think the progression of ideas is. v1 we care about truth v2 it's all tribal infotainment no one cares v3 actually financial and technological decision makers really do care about truth A step towards this is Axios' bullet point summaries. But cryptography provides a level up in trust. Argument from cryptography gt argument from authority. Basically move from tweets to cryptographically signed on chain assertions. A for the record button. For example the recent hack wouldn't have been possible if Twitter used digital signatures. Bezos would keep a file on his laptop that he used to sign his posts. An attacker would then have to compromise that file to post as him. You cryptographically verify every post. Yes the core issue is that popularity isn't truth. And 's ideas are good. But I think the next system must use cryptography. who via digital signature what via hash when via timestamp That's how we establish unambiguous truth in an adversarial environment. It also truly is a full stack problem. You can't fund media today without thinking about how social media sets and distorts everyone's incentives. Crypto amp NLP do offer us a number of new tools however and that's where a lot of thought is going. Some examples Kristof's article inspiring Gates to go after public health Minority Report sparking Kinect and other tech and Ready Player One inspiring Oculus. Inspiring journalists filmmakers and authors could be integrated into the financing pipeline to receive a share. We also need mechanisms to realign tech media and society. One concept is if your article or film inspires someone to found a great company that solves a social problem eg fusion energy to address climate as media creator you get a piece of the investment in cash amp equity. Yang's right. Btw tech really does want to fund media amp is thinking deeply about it. But we need better incentives for both media AND social media. Otherwise we'll get no handshakes pieces followed by no retractions. Due to social media that maximizes popularity over truth. Btw it might be interesting to do a polite written debate sometime. I do believe the universalist version of Western values Bitcoin Mars etc should win in the long term. But I think we need to take China seriously as a peer competitor while avoiding war. I have nothing against Zeihan and think some of his work on natural resources is interesting. However his 2010 prediction of China collapse by 2020 didn't come to pass and I generally think his worldview overweights geography amp underweights technology. That's an interesting counterargument. Essentially that the damage has already been done. Here's a counter to that counter many organizations and businesses that might have survived a few months can't survive a much longer period and are giving up. That'd be the moment when people claim China is actually ahead. From there many possible branches. 1 Ignore. GDP doesn't matter. 2 Accept defeat. The West lost and or should have lost. 3 Reboot perhaps as per . 4 Something else? Here's the thing. 1 If both these trends continue for another year where the US drops 30 40 and China muddles through 2 And if you believe these numbers Then China may overtake the US in GDP by mid 2021. Conversely China reports that its GDP rebounded in Q2. Of course they may well have massaged the numbers. However it does appear they have been hit less hard by COVID 19 if we triangulate from reports on the ground. The actual drop in GDP relative to Q2 last year was 9.5 not 32.9 . However if the impact of COVID 19 continues for another year we might actually see something like a true 30 40 drop in GDP. One possible UX would be like Google Analytics' AI query bar shown below. Use natural language queries to pull info from across your company. You might need to do a v2 of GPT 3 with the capacity to link the input data that led it to a particular suggestion. By restricting to internally public strings we obviate privacy issues for v1. It's a global AI. A v2 might give personalized AI avatars for each employee. If employee A has access to read employee B's writing they can ask B's AI avatar a question. May be useful if B is asleep. GPT 3 Corporate AI when? Replace your knowledge base with a godlike AI that has indexed every internally public string ever written by someone at your company. Pulls in Slack Docs Github… Btw somewhat relatedly this is a cool thread on crawling the IPFS. It's not structured like a typical blockchain where you can start at the genesis block and just download the whole thing. Instead you have to traverse the IPFS distributed hash table. Already happening Another way of thinking about blockchains is that they're open state databases. Anyone can read or write. As such they provide a vision for how one might open up the backend of Facebook or Twitter in a privacy respecting data integrity preserving way. At least in theory Also true that it's quite bandwidth intensive to do a big crawl of the internet so that's a deterrent as well. I've been thinking more about how important open state databases like Common Crawl are. It was an input to GPT 3. What else can we do with it? Chain crawling is easier than web crawling. Websites have robots.txt files that prevent the hoi polloi from indexing them. But public blockchains have no such thing. Every user is a root user because these are open state databases. Yeah though it depends on how hard the aggregation is. Chain crawling is somewhat easier than web crawling. Blockchains don't have an equivalent of robots.txt. There is no way to prevent a random user from indexing a chain. So a Common Crawl for crypto would be less useful. gt which said that truth no longer matters in journalism Here's my argument how many retractions corrections and apologies have we seen for the early COVID 19 coverage? First she was a producer for seven years amp said this happens at all commercial networks. Second here's CJR Nick Kristof and Jill Abramson saying same thing the quest for clicks distorts coverage. The problem is real. It's due to social media too of course. Mike these are large multinational corporations that offer a product like any other. Just like we could critique BlackBerry Barnes amp Noble and Blockbuster I'd hope we can criticize Comcast the 197B parent corp in question. These entities have power yes? First when media corps critique other groups a single individual is often profiled as representative. Agree? Second she's by no means the only person to raise these points either inside or outside. Worth listening to the critique. Remember a few months ago when we predicted smart masks due to the high stakes and massive daily use? It's happening. 2 independent confirmations of content  Well all blockchain users are equal to root users in that sense as well as none of them have the unilateral ability to delete data change schema shut down the DB or change params like the 21 million BTC limit. Every user is equal. All can read amp write no one can delete. Did you read it? You can put a relational layer on top of a blockchain which every exchange does. That's not the key distinction. The key is that anyone in the world gets full read access . And write access given crypto or compute . That's not true for say Twitter's DB. By the way I have probably 100 essays sitting on the web or in draft that I want to collect at the site. This piece is a republication with some edits of an article from May 2019. This one is for all the non crypto engineers. Are you using AWS Google Cloud or Azure? And have you wondered what value a blockchain adds over a traditional DB? The short answer is public blockchains accommodate millions of simultaneous root users. Aren't blockchains just databases? Yes but a special kind. Public blockchains are massively multiclient databases where every user is a root user. v1 facts are important v2 facts don't matter only tribal narratives do v3 actually facts really do matter especially for financial and technological decision makers See some examples in this thread where facts resolved recent disputes. Part of that better way may be the ledger of record. Mathematically provable facts that people can agree on regardless of ideology. But another part may be aligning media creators with the health amp wealth of the people they inform. Skin in the game. Read it all. Here are four of the most notable passages on the corporate distortion of truth. Please note this is not partisan. It happens at all for profit media outlets and is amplified by social media engagement algorithms. We need a better way. This resignation letter by Ariana Pekary from MSNBC is worth reading in full. It documents the complete breakdown of our information supply chain due to bad incentives. For media corporations truth no longer matters. Only popularity does in the form of ratings and clicks. Social networks can actually help with this a lot. Put your work and portfolio online and you can connect with people in an organic way outside of the formal environment of a job fair. Also access to a professional network has been opened up in a way it never was before. Tools like GitHub Twitter etc allow you to find people in your field and talk to them. I don't even think college alumni networks are that valuable anymore. Would be interesting to measure. I say this in all honesty absolutely not. Stanford isn't what it was academia isn't what it was. I wish I had the internet then so I could have started my life earlier. Getting all those degrees may have been a reasonable decision many years ago but it's not optimal anymore. No. The people who can point a gun at you have power. They can literally jail you for not sending your kid to school. This is an antiquated system that needs to be replaced. This is part of the difference between the East Coast vs tech mentality. Much of the East Coast is about inherited wealth nepotism old institutions groupthink hypocrisy. They project that onto tech. But tech actually believes what they are saying. I applaud you for asking about skin in the game But there's a key point here. Technological progressives really do use the things they say they use. Whereas technological conservatives say they like public school then send their kids to private school. Sincerity vs hypocrisy. Good insight. It may be the case that you have a relatively small number of star teachers who create engaging digital textbooks maybe aided by AI to give personalized attention to each student . And an in person facilitator who is focused on childcare. Division of labor. Just like desktop software development made sense 20 30 years ago college may have made sense for the last generation. It doesn't anymore. The price performance isn't there. And you don't need it for a good job. They are real and already being adopted. Why send your kids to college? To go into debt for Zoom classes? Do a serious open source project build a large Substack or create a strong portfolio. Then apply for a job or start a company. That's much more impressive than a degree. There's already good energy around college replacement Coursera Udacity Udemy Lambda School YC and then specialist sites like and Binance Academy. But K 12 is different as you have a physical childcare component that is missing from adult education.\", 'best example tool price roughly one headcount like looker david burt spearhead project use

David Burt is spearheading projects to use the island as a testing ground for stablecoins and to launch a communally owned national digital bank. Bermuda a new remote work destination for crypto people? In the best case scenario all the companies that burnt trust in a burst of censorious madness find they can only regain it by going crypto on everything. Decentralized cryptographic verification of information supply chain starting with Verizon? ? It’s brinkmanship. It kills trust in their institution. It’s the waiter openly spitting on the ground right next to your table. The whole value prop of an immutable archive is we will not edit . This is why chain of custody is a thing. Because motivated tampering is a thing. You have an untouched archive and provide commentary offsite. There are literally millions of commentary feeds to add color and only a few archival sites. Sad they decided to destroy trust in their institution. Without cryptographic validation you can no longer trust the site. In both cases the entire value proposition is about trust. Trust that it wasn’t maliciously tampered with. The fact that the has publicly signaled that they CAN edit the archives means trust in their stewardship has evaporated. Fortunately we have crypto. A waiter spits on the ground next to your food. Stares at you. Sure you didn’t see him spit in your food An immutable archive edits the banner right above your link. It’s staring at you. Sure you didn’t see them edit the content itself More 1984 every day. Thankfully we have decentralized storage systems coming online just as the older systems get Orwellian. Not just blockchains but IPFS CRDTs and other dweb tech. Plus older but still important tools like git BitTorrent etc. I did note the presence of proper nouns like Git and Elixir in the headlines so they probably want to SEO for candidates with those skills. But the sections I looked at were actually really high quality writing not slapdash stuff. Hopefully this pays for itself. Well that’s an imperative now. You have to become a tech co to survive. I think the issue is that technology is not identical to the tech industry . Some people love money too much others hate it too much. But money is not our highest value. Math is the true core of CS. Note deleted amp reposted two tweets in this thread because included slightly wrong link. The Coder Stories link is the right one. Take a look at the screenshots below to see an alternative vision of what tech writing might look like. Informative amp fun One thing that jumps out at me from those pieces social media isn’t the only factor in reducing the quality of tech writing. Once technology became the tech industry amp worth billions many people got into it just for money. Coverage gradually dumbed down to focus on funding. This whole series of articles is some of the best tech journalism I’ve ever seen. Because it’s not all gossip columns and funding rounds. The reader actually learns something. It’s like but for tech. Great work by on this interview. Really illustrates some key concepts including a that technically literate people should be writing amp reporting on tech b there’s plenty of talent out there internationally we haven’t tapped and c we can do so much better. Want a totally fresh take on tech journalism? Behold an interviewer who knows enough about DNS to conduct an informative interview with the inventor of DNS. Here’s a tutorial on setting up hosted Ghost at your own domain. You can switch over to self hosted Ghost when ready. Wordpress also works in a similar way you can start hosted and move to self hosted. Substack is excellent and keeps improving. But if you want a polished open source alternative where you can self host everything that’s . It’s never been more important to ask the question can it scale? Who could have predicted that censorship would censor the censor calling for censorship? The core of science is independent replication not peer review. But we don’t have wind tunnels or inclined planes at home. We can’t easily replicate scientific experiments. Or can we? We do have devices capable of doing billions of computations. We can at least check the math. Put another way we have millions of independent replications and billions of devices that give experimental confirmation of Maxwell’s equations. That’s science. And that’s very different from some just published data analysis. That’s not science it’s a provisional result. The abuse of science in the name of science was particularly egregious this year. What it boils down to is stealing the prestige of Maxwell’s equations for some shaky data analysis. The level of independent replication differs by orders of magnitude. Very abstract discussion. The employer knows their unit economics. They have local knowledge. They can see if a minimum wage hike will put their business underwater. Perhaps there is global benefit doubtful but relatively few entities have the microeconomic data to show that. How do you deal with times when the network completely drops? Use local autonomy and just pull over? Or something else? Bitcoin has been a store of value and medium of exchange for some time but it’s also become a unit of account. Every investment in the cryptoeconomy is benchmarked against BTC. Because property is defended with encryption not violence. How world leaders meet 1910 kings wearing royal attire in a castle 2000 politicians wearing suits and ties at Davos 2020 CEOs wearing hoodies and flip flops on a Zoom call There may be a restricted subset of English that is more translation friendly. The new spell check is translation check? More people in the crypto community should be aware of this. Because it’s possible to have property rights and smart contracts enforced by the network rather than any one entity. This may result in more competitive markets long term and less vulnerability to centralized states and corporations alike. I actually very much disagree with Zeihan on most things other than fracking’s geopolitical importance . Longer critique here in this podcast. Maybe worth an essay. Crypto Capital is the hope of the rest of the world. It is stateless capitalism it is capitalism without corporations it is decentralized censorship resistance and it is principled non violence. And it is the youngest but may yet prove the strongest. Woke Capital is the ideology of much of modern America. It’s capitalism that enables decentralized censorship cancel culture and American empire. It’s drone strike democracy. Communist Capital is the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party. It’s capitalism checked by the centralized power of the Chinese state as pithily summarized here. Each represents a left right fusion that’s bizarre by the standards of the 1980s consensus. It’s PRC vs MMT vs BTC. The future is Communist Capital vs Woke Capital vs Crypto Capital. Another angle Twitter search is distinct from Google search in that it’s harder to invisibly censor. That’s because Google’s rankings shift constantly in a non transparent way but it’s very obvious when a Twitter user is banned. A search canary kind of like a warrant canary. Here’s the serious version. Build global companies. Use decentralized technologies. And hire from the 96 of the world that is not American and the large percentage of Americans that aren’t obsessed with US politics. Remember the New York Times Company announced it is becoming a tech company. That means it has gotten in the ring. This is not some public trust it’s a 7B firm aiming for 70B. Coke doesn’t help Pepsi. Google doesn’t aid FB. Why should you give free content to a competitor? Build your own media arm. Don’t respond to employees of legacy media corps. Whatever you have to say say it in your own words. Better yet say it in your own film. Just don’t consent to giving them free content. Bezos Sulzberger and Murdoch already have enough money. The new vanity metric is vanity media. You simply do not need legacy media coverage to reach an audience. It’s junk traffic. You no longer need to pay a toll to a media middleman to reach an audience. You don’t need them at all. The internet destroyed one of the media’s most important sources of power being the only place that could offer access to an audience. Media corporations are slowly realizing that leverage has shifted. You don’t need to give free content to Bezos Sulzberger or Murdoch employees to get the word out anymore. Just build your own audience and go direct if you have something to say. BTC and ETH may each handle close to a trillion dollars of volume this year. People outside the space simply do not understand the scale of the cryptoeconomy. A key reason this is feasible ride sharing interfaces haven’t changed in years. That means you can freeze the frontend and decentralize the backend. Of course the protocol version of Uber would be more complex just like Bitcoin was more complex than PayPal. But it would win. So what eventually happens is that all these platforms get turned into crypto protocols. Every rider and driver now share in the upside. And due to encryption voluntary transactions between two parties can no longer be surveilled and interdicted by the state. I’m very sympathetic to and ’s points about making sure workers share upside. Had Uber been able to give equity to all 1M drivers perhaps they’d be a 100B company with 50B owned by drivers at 50k driver. A happier and economically aligned workforce. Absolutely agree that workers should share in the upside of these platforms. But a state that fails at basic functions like police fire public health education sanitation isn’t capable of competent regulation. That’s why AB5 was a disaster. There is a better way though On chain or it didn’t happen. While just for fun today putting data on chain will replace formal marriage registries in 10 20 years. Deprecate the state replace it with the network. Ledger of record gt paper of record Forget NYT Vows. Record your indissoluble bond on the immutable blockchain. Remember also that early operating systems and browsers operated in highly resource constrained environments. Programs needed to be optimized to the kilobyte or sometimes the byte. We're still in that era in crypto. But extrapolate out five ten fifteen twenty years Those are absolutely up there too. You can argue that Unreal and Unity are basically operating systems in that they are targets for virtual worlds. Eventually I think these all converge into VR AR based operating systems with virtual currencies that can be accessed via web URLs. We already knew how crypto enables competition with Facebook amp Twitter. Crypto social networks improve monetization identity hosting etc. But the OS lens gives a long term roadmap for competing with parts of Google Apple MS. Use a blockchain to go after the OS and browser. One consequence of this line of thinking the era of operating system innovation may be about to begin again. It's been Linux Mac Windows for generations. But modern blockchains have UXs block explorers communities interoperability novel applications and monetization. A web browser is after all essentially an OS. It has an interpreter you write apps for it and so on. ChromeOS took this to its natural conclusion. A blockchain is also an OS. It has a compiler you write apps for it and so on. What will take this to its natural conclusion? These reflect the on disk online and on chain eras respectively. From desktop to internet to crypto. The three most complex pieces of software are operating systems web browsers and blockchains. If you can use an algorithm to determine whether the content is near the policy line then you can reduce the reach of the post. Importantly because these algorithms would run upon a blockchain or similar decentralized datastore they would not just be open source. They'd be open state and open execution. A glass box where you can see every database entry amp replay every opcode. In this model all community members would consciously opt in to a crypto social network with a transparent backend governance model and social contract. Content standards would be arrived upon by a community with enforcement by transparent algorithms. An alternative approach that is becoming more feasible is open state backend like a blockchain community imposed content standards transparent algorithmic enforcement pseudonymous crypto governance A crypto social network for each community. Of course the problem with ML based pre publication content review by FB Twitter is that these are for profit American companies put in the role of soft censoring millions. I think many people there have good intent but as folks have noted the potential for abuse is obvious. Right now the policy line is determined by community reaction or manual platform review. So there are humans in the loop. However if FB or Twitter's databases were open source anyone could try ML to try predicting virality amp sentiment for a post. Probably some signal there. A fundamental issue is that viral content tends to be provocative. In theory it's possible to change the incentive structure as shown by these two graphs. Great metaphor for Twitter. In context of course it's meant to be a joke. But also has some validity in that one may be assessing along the wrong dimensions. Changing just the Y axis will get you a higher fraction of blues higher standards but altering your coordinate system will get you 100 blue. From a machine learning perspective standards that are too high result in false negatives. Standards that are too low result in false positives. But better algorithms can reduce both false positives and false negatives. gt founders aren't going to be able to build a meaningful audience First many founders tweeting in their spare time have built larger followings than entire newspapers. Second failing to build an audience in 2020 is like failing to build a website. It’s a necessary task. Write your own software. Create your own media. Right. You can’t just add PR sauce to an uninteresting product and get people interested. Good article. I think it’s more like war war war peace though. Takes a long time before a company can really just coast and afford to make mistakes. If you are selling nonsense as a service PR won’t help. Selling non nonsense may. After that you still need to get the word out somehow. But rather than doing so indirectly via legacy media corporations you go direct through your own media arm. Btw many PR people will adapt or already have. was one of the first to do first party original content for tech and helped build the a16z podcast into a real source of tech news. I think we’ll see much more of that. Editors in chief not VP Comms. Be the media. Editor in chief will become a C level position at many tech companies over the 2020s. On par with CTO or COO. It’s a more descriptive title than VP of Communications. Because it signifies that tech is building its own full stack media arms. Yes. The partnerships that work tend to be simple distribution deals. The partnerships that don’t tend to be boondoggles where no one can articulate how the money is made let alone how it is split. Sales is hard but much more straightforward by comparison. Not saying I doubt but this would be a great retrospective analysis. For each historical election you have the predicted winner and probability of winning from both 538 and a given prediction market. And the actual winner. Tabulate that data and make graphs. Present company excepted of course. But there were thousands of articles that were confident condescending and wrong. When it comes to misinformation on COVID 19 unfortunately the legacy press and the state both completely failed. Remember Don’t Worry About Coronavirus Worry About the Flu and No Handshakes Please and Stop Wearing Masks ? No retractions no resignations no trust. One way to bootstrap your new company’s media arm is to start with a founding influencer or recruit one early on. Then grow this into something more professional over time. I have no beef with Electrek and think you do some good work. But Electrek like any media company is just a corporation. Another corporation has the right and nowadays the obligation to build its own media arm. You may write positive and negative stories about each other. Point being that the concept of the press as a entity distinct from the citizenry at large is going away. Every citizen a citizen journalist. And just as NYT is becoming a tech company tech firms are building media arms. Every company a media company. Typist used to be a profession. Now everyone types. And everyone writes. And publishes to the internet. And has a YouTube and podcast and so on. Often with larger followings than the professionals. And the professionals likewise are going to Substack. So we are all equal now. Limited space in one tweet. But I suggest that this is the new model build your own domain specific in house media arm. After all Comcast owns NBC Bezos owns the Post etc. Media companies are just corporations at the end of the day. Decentralize your PR. Rather than spending 100k on the next PR person why not give ten 10k fellowships to up and coming influencers around the world who’ve demonstrated interest in your area? Like Nike sponsoring athletes sponsor creators with proven talent in your field. The old model of PR was propitiating legacy media corporations. The new model is to build your own serious media arm. Learn to code. Then learn to write report publish direct. Start with a blog graduate to a YouTube TV channel. Or something like Stripe Press. Be creative. As every company becomes a media company every citizen becomes a citizen journalist. Want a quote from ? Check his feed like everyone else. Everyone gets access to the same info at the same time. The whole concept of giving free content quotes interviews to legacy media corporations is obsolete. It’s a habit. A bad habit. Break it. And if you have news to break break it on your own channels your Twitter YouTube podcast or blog. Don’t have a channel? Build one. Every company is now a media company. Go direct if you have something to say. Ideally ubiquitous translation leads to greater understanding between countries. But maybe it just means the entire world is engulfed in one endless social flamewar even more than today. Or conversely that people overseas have a much larger voice in US events. Or all three Machine translation will eventually be ubiquitous. Real time translation of everything you say hear read and write. This is one of those predictable events with unpredictable consequences. More than 95 of the world is not American. Worth keeping in mind. This woke is feeling particularly bold today calling a thot . That’s not acceptable behavior and he probably needs to hear that. It’s always the wokest whites who want to silence immigrants women and people of color. This is what I had in mind. I drew a separate set of triangles though. Good idea to set one length to 1 to simplify the algebra. Yes. Way more people are willing to invest capital than reputational capital. It is interesting how few figures there tend to be in some of the Springer texts. Often you can summarize a whole chapter with a good figure. Right. But that’s like defining a random variable in terms of sigma algebras and Borel sets. It makes sense after you’ve built intuition with elementary derivations. You may be right. They have a recommendation engine where you can give it more examples and it generates more logos like the one you selected so that was my presumption. But under the hood it could well be eg just a deterministic algorithm with a pseudorandom seed. Yeah that’s the one I was thinking of. With some inscribed triangles. It’s a bit of a pain to set up but you can get there with just definitions of cosine and sine similar triangles and some algebra. Yeah. But what’s the pre calc derivation? To get Euler’s formula you need limits power series imaginary numbers other pieces of machinery. Eg I’m not sure if you could get to the derivative of cos x without the cos A B formula which means you can’t get the power series. It’s sometimes fun to rederive the basic stuff. Can you get the formula for cos A B from scratch without looking it up? Try . Pretty decent AI based fast logo builder. The alternative is that kind of debate every day in every Slack channel. Enough. Starkware has a great writeup of their entry in the recent scaling bake off here This may produce a radical reduction in Ethereum gas costs. Cavalry is coming. How do we replace argument from authority with argument from cryptography? Here is a sketch of some of the mathematical ideas. The present of journalism is Brooklyn's wokest. The future is decentralized cryptographic truth. This NYT journalist spends more energy attacking tiny American startups than investigating giant Chinese conglomerates. Why? Because she has 500k followers on TikTok and someone criticized her on Clubhouse once. The Interchain We’re still in the pre Oauth era of crypto. Chains as domains is a useful concept as they are decentralized hosts of code and data. But interchain routing is non systematic right now. We need a general way to address remote code on one chain from another chain. Cities may not be able to financially endure this. Many were already in a parlous state prior to COVID. We may see a wave of municipal bankruptcies. To prevent this or at least reduce the impact it’s important that discussion happens in some neutral forum. Not Weibo Chinese or Twitter American . May have to be something genuinely censorship resistant perhaps even pseudonymous. See also this thread A crypto Cyanogen is probably possible in 2020. An open source Android fork built to accommodate crypto. Similar to what Brave did with Chrome. Make a crypto wallet as core to the offering as the browser. And build everything around that. What’s also clear is that Armstrong believes he’s far from alone among his C Suite peers not just at Coinbase or in the crypto industry but among executive teams across corporate America And Armstrong is probably right to think so. I do agree with you that the coverage of the situation in China was sober. But there was an arrogant tone to the domestic coverage an assumption that it couldn't happen in America. This led to the country being completely unprepared. Evelyn that's simply not the case. WaPo NYT Opinion BuzzFeed Wired CNN and many more downplayed it for weeks. Recode infamously put the virus is contained in their no handshakes piece. Infographic below has some clips. See also thread. gt there were several news sources reporting on covid in January Oh they were reporting on it. But they were saying it wasn’t going to be a problem in the US. Here’s a sample thread from Jan 30. Computational analysis of literature. In this groundbreaking book Franco Moretti argues that literature scholars should stop reading books and start counting graphing and mapping them instead. Online is easier though. Offline world has built in delays and lags and so on. So it will start with digital professions Wow amazing cite. Moretti’s work looks awesome. I check in on it every few years here's what I saw a while ago One interesting concept is to prove you still have this skill clear this level again. All the cost of a college education includes zero budget for lifelong maintenance. Incorporating 's finding on mnemonic media could be very helpful. I think a fundamental difference is that it's interactive and hence bidirectional. You couldn't do this with broadcast television. Related to 's excellent essay here I've been looking at the gamification of early childhood education. Some apps like Tynker are really quite good. It seems obvious that this trend will eventually transform what we now know of as high school collegiate and even professional education. This joke is at least twenty years old but still good. Obviously if you actually cared about the correctness of the articles that appear on your site you'd take pains to downrank any outlets that didn't run retractions for immensely consequential falsehoods. But I don't want to distract from your real job of chasing clicks Somehow those tech journalists styled themselves experts in public health remember? Get a single retraction from these people. What they did was shameful. Gabe you did a phenomenal job getting the news out no wait you didn't and neither did your friends. Please get them to retract. No handshakes please A crypto exchange is like a massively multiplayer online video game where you can win or lose in real life. I’m actually surprised that no one has developed game interfaces for running a business yet. Trading on crypto exchanges already feels like this. To some extent so does Twitter for media. Metrics dashboards and GPT 3 NPC chatbots might allow you to push this concept further. You got it. Now think about how big the trust problem is in other areas. And if you can replace or reduce the need for trust with computation that allows us to build high trust layers on top of a low trust internet. basically trust but verify gt trust if verified Noah asks a key question who but China can step into the gap as the US turns inward? The counterintuitive answer may be new entities born from the internet. After all crypto offers governance primitives tech produces competent leaders and the internet is international… This is an interesting discussion between and on US China relations. It's more substantive than most Twitter repartee and gives a good snapshot of the Chinese nationalist and fast disappearing American internationalist views.  9 It spreads the wealth more broadly than tech which itself was a major innovation in terms of giving stock options to employees. Crypto gt equity gt salary in terms of the ability to align more people towards a common goal. 8 It’s also a wholly new way to develop and monetize apps. As different from the cloud as cloud was from desktop. With similar consequences for incumbents. on disk online on chain zero servers centralized servers decentralized servers 7 It’s the best of the West transparency technical excellence rule of law equality of opportunity yet set up in such a way that anyone who subscribes to those values can be part of it. From imperfect proposition nations to engineered proposition currencies. 6 It is truly international capitalism and steps into the vacuum as America descends into nationalist socialism. As such it’s what wins in the long run. Americans and Chinese don’t respect each others’ governments or currencies but millions on both sides do hold Bitcoin. 5 It is far more risk tolerant and genuinely rebellious than what SV has become over the last ten years note though that SV is still an improvement over the legacy paradigm of getting an MBA. Far better to get a CEO degree. 4 It is an alternative to many legacy institutions Wall Street decentralized finance Silicon Valley decentralized protocols Yale Law smart contracts Columbia Journalism crypto oracles Federal Reserve algorithmic monetary policy Harvard KSG on chain governance Some of the reasons why 1 It has much more philosophical depth than tech. Can’t understand BTC without history 2 It has an international remote first shared culture built around common memes 3 It is technologically harder than most web apps which has a selective effect Crypto is what comes after Silicon Valley. Yeah but the point is that they match up transactions in a crypto company's database with the public transactions on chain. And the latter are taken as being the gold standard of truth. Which means they understand how Bitcoin and Ethereum use cryptography for tamper resistance. Companies really operate as business networks today not stand alone entities. Actually a fairly sophisticated way of thinking about what network capitalism really means. It’s the natural extension of APIs cloud remote and so on. More porous business boundaries. Strong work by Ernst and Young Btw many people don’t realize that the Big Four use public blockchains as the gold standard of truth when producing audited financials for crypto companies. Because they can’t be falsified. So blockchains have already transformed accounting. The VR Picasso is a cryptographically verified original. Sometimes it really is the case that more technology is the solution to a problem inadvertently caused by technology. The trivial example being a bug fix. I actually agree with about many of the negative features of today’s social media. But I don’t think the answer is the regulatory state but rather new tech that fixes these issues both in the form of crypto and new products . No matter the format or author the arguments arrayed against the social media giants by the professional chattering class boil down to three broad classes arranged in rough order of intelligence •Luddism •Regulation •Antitrust Let’s examine them each in turn. That’s a good critique. I didn’t generate the chart and so don’t know their methodology. But if they did something like what does a giant flat panel screen cost today vs 30 year ago you can get 10 100X reductions. Certainly for computers you get there. Massive sectors of course that have spawned political movements to end all student loans and give free healthcare because they are so expensive Also Yeah but why does Baumol happen? One reason is that those tend to be highly regulated and subsidized industries where you can’t cut costs because it’s illegal. For example until this year telemedicine was hobbled because doctors couldn’t practice across state borders. Yes exactly these are the big areas. Also on the original chart housing appears to have kept pace with wages when aggregated over everyone. But other studies claim that rent has grown faster than wages. That fits experience in urban areas at least. The other thing is that the chart by itself doesn’t show how much of someone’s spend goes to education healthcare rent as opposed to TVs amp phones. Of course this varies on per person basis. But that means the bite of price inflation or benefit of deflation is felt differently. No it shows wages in the center of the chart with some things growing faster and some things growing more slowly. You could renormalize the chart in wage terms making the wage line flat and it’d look similar. gt shows wages growing faster than virtually every category No it shows wages in the center of the chart with some things growing faster and some things growing more slowly. You could renormalize the chart in wage terms making the wage line flat and it’d look similar. You are both friends so no need to fight At least for this question just one part of the whole I think we need to look at granular time series of which countries are buying treasuries in each month. Hard to see trends from aggregate charts. The inflation is here it’s just not evenly distributed. See graph. I expect this to get even more intense over the next decade hyperdeflation of the digital inflation of the physical such that the digital version of anything is the first choice. What would you consider an alternative empirical test? Would like to understand what would invalidate the MMT worldview. For example would other countries choosing to use other currencies beside the dollar count as evidence against MMT? The empirical grounding is the success of the alternative namely the size of the cryptoeconomy. Today in the hundreds of billions. Will grow to trillions and eventually tens of trillions. They are shifting strategies now due to the trade war. They will refocus on domestic consumption and Belt amp Road. I love that we’ll be able to put our philosophies to the empirical test this decade. As we discussed last year I anticipated this showdown in the 2020s. Didn’t realize at the time that COVID would accelerate it. But of course MMT enriches crypto folks so it’s complicated I agree with the spirit of your comment though which is that leaders of vision would be welcome BTC is very much above board these days. Mainstream and Wall Street adoption etc. Disagree for many reasons. 1 The state isn’t a competent capital allocator. See COVID SF CA etc 2 Everything needs an ROI even a bridge or tunnel. See Strong Towns 3 It’s all going remote so road infra for non self driving is rearward looking. Btw I want someone to make a better version of this graph over the long term as it crops the y axis. Still it does show the directional trend. Hard to imagine China won’t liquidate more after the TikTok thing. Oh I am familiar Love the movie which says the US economy is a tank of water and that money printing is not just something we can do but should do. Ultimately these kinds of policies benefit crypto people so I can’t really argue against it but Indeed ask me about Bitcoin It’s only gone from 0 to 100B in ten years. It’s not just US debt. The dollar is a technology platform. Every country that trades with the US that buys oil for that denominates contracts in and so on subsidizes the dollar. The main value right now is as a Schelling point. If not our national currency then what It augurs a new phase the phase of explicit empire. That will result in grudging compliance accompanied by an intensifying search for exit over the medium to long run. It’s like Oracle the vendor people hate. They can milk it for sometime. But not forever. I’m bearish on the US baseish on China but bullish on the Internet. Bitcoin is currently the 35 currency globally. Will probably be top 10 after next run. And it’s valued by many Americans AND Chinese. Hence it’s the long run winner. gt no matter how profligate the government gets the dollar is the last wealth reserve This is a TINA argument. But the alternatives are coming DCEP BTC . As the US becomes increasingly nationalist and socialist it just becomes a worse business partner for other countries. It’s true that incumbency has an advantage. And buys you some time. But China is launching DCEP and BTC is at 100B and the US government is printing trillions of dollars. None of that augurs well for the US dollar over the long term. China has been exiting treasuries for a while. Why would you buy US treasuries? Yield has been falling off a cliff. Yes. But they can’t point those guns at the whole world to force them to hold dollars. The endgame of MMT is extremely predictable. Capital flight the end of the dollar as a reserve currency the end of the US as a global power etc. Thank god for Satoshi. Things at this scale can take decades or generations to play out. Kick the can and pass it down one more decade or generation. It’ll be a worse problem but not your problem. That’s been going on for a while. Who knows how long it has left to go. Well MMT does mean BTC holders will become millionaires. Along with everyone else of course. Of course prescriptive MMT doesn’t make any economic sense. The only logic behind it is that the state has guns. Krugman at least is smart enough to get this. I haven’t actually seen an analysis that totals up all the fiscal and monetary stimulus thus far this year. I remember when a 787B stimulus package was a big deal. Now we are at 10X that number Though we don’t know to the nearest trillion how much the state has spent. America is now a welfare state in a novel sense of the term a state which depends on the welfare of other states. It prints trillions of dollars. That’s its primary export. Dollar holders around the world subsidize the increasingly insane hijinks. Eventually that will stop. Yeah. Regulation is information. You hear about the false positives. The bad things that got through. But the false negatives also exist. The good things that didn’t. The current system isn’t set up to carefully track both of these rates. Much of it is TSA style safety theater. Google Eroom’s law . US regulations drive up the price of drug discovery. As do patents. The American state makes drugs artificially expensive through these two mechanisms of artificial scarcity. Given the egregiously poor performance of the CDC FDA and indeed USA in the COVID 19 crisis many countries are reassessing whether they really want to outsource biomedical regulatory policymaking to the US. Not something to imitate. Harmonization is a word many don’t know. It’s a process of carrots and sticks by which American regulations become global standards. Note that the bureaucrats who write these rules typically have career tenure. They can’t be fired and weren’t elected. Regulatory harmonization exports US hegemony. That is a small number of American regulators accountable neither to the electorate nor the market write the biomedical policies for the whole world. For a country like India to actually be sovereign it needs its own rules. That’s too harsh. Plus he’s plenty well off to be able to exit without issue. It’s more about thinking ideas through in public. Blockchains can be thought of as massively multiclient databases. Every user is a root user. Good analogy The 21 theses of institutional decentralization. Human subjects research of course adds cost to any replication. And you might decide to lean on a previous study rather than incur that cost. But at some point you may need someone to voluntarily take an informed risk. We would never be able to fly without test pilots. See Everyone repeating what scientists say adds no signal. Independent replication is the core of science not institutional reputation peer review or endless repetition. If you tell me you reproduced the research I might believe you. If you tell me scientists say then I’ll just ask you for the original paper. From the open web to the open chains. Twitter. I’m serious. Just engage with investors on here. You don’t need a warm intro just a great demo or screenshot that fits into a single tweet or DM. No guarantees of course. But you just need to attract one. The STARK forest This is why social networking is not a winner take all market. We need different channels for our different contradicting online personas. Fascinating. Post encrypted messages on public social networks such that only your friends can decrypt them. Basically turns any platform into an E2E messaging app. Will be interesting to see if this behavior is adopted. Interesting concept. Maybe a little too manual though. Wouldn’t you want it to look like a standard indented list of bullets and then just display outlines at levels 1 2 3 4 by just hitting a single button at the top? Some HQs are legacy. Some folks have bought houses. But fundraising has moved online and that’s the big thing. Not just Zoom pitches but rolling funds and of course crypto. Especially at the angel and seed level people are getting more comfortable writing a check remotely. Love ’s feed. And he’s a great salesperson. But one remark this is starting to sound like a pitch for Europe. Hey the weather is nice and the restaurants… A huge shift from the obviously world dominant capital of tech to a place you need to pitch people on to stay. The argument for CA nowadays boils down to scenery. I get it. But there are a lot of beautiful warm inexpensive places with good internet. See and to find some. The main asset of the Bay Area was the in person network. No more. This really shows what Twitter could be. Imagine if cards were useful for doing something Exactly. It’s one thing for pre existing companies to continue using SV as a legacy base of operations. But now that you can raise online and work from anywhere would a new company really put the expensive dysfunctional Bay Area at the top of the list? Neptune and Browserstack seem like classic SaaS though I may be missing something. I like Plotly but not sure what their latest business model is. Rough analogy Twitter issues usernames when people sign up. Usernames are valuable amp there is a decentralized marketplace in names. But Twitter didn't set the price. Similarly issuing karma tokens badges NFTs or usernames ENS to users might result in organic value. Note you can do this without putting any price on the token. No ICO. Just issue it to users like a social reward similar to karma or likes or badges. If the community puts a price on the token or NFT that's then an emergent property. Organic decentralization? Yes that's one approach. But essentially the proprietary part is the community. Which can be quantified by paid subscriptions to a community forum holding of a token or both. Yes.. The token is used to buy time from developers in their marketplace and to access API itself. Here's an old piece i should update with coins vs tokens . tokens are not equity but are more similar to paid API keys Thesis many SaaS companies will eventually issue a karma token or be outcompeted by one that does . They set up a developer marketplace StackOverflow equivalent where experts earn and charge crypto karma for advice. Would work for Figma Mixpanel etc. The consulting model didn't scale because you had to keep finding great engineers and selling their time by the hour. Hard to do that endlessly. The community model does scale because essentially each community member is buying time from each other. You're just the moderator. Open source business models. Consulting v1 open source the code sell consulting Cloud v2 open source some code but sell a closed source cloud complement Community v3 open source all code and issue a token or charge for access to the community Yeah. A good augmentation mechanism might be to generate a list of suggested named entities and then allow the user to say yeah nay across them. Move extremely fast and break the sound barrier Amazing accomplishment. I'm actually not arguing for centralization. If the evaluator has a repo with the code to assess some Project Euler style problems and the applicant has a separate repo with the code to solve these problems then you can put them together such that evaluator can score applicant. 4 It is moderately hard to fake as copy pasted code would be somewhat obvious. You might defeat much of this with automated item generation in which variations of a given Project Euler style problem are created from a random seed. Why might this be a good standard? 1 It has the quantitative element did you get the answer right or not? 2 It has the qualitative element what does your source code look like? 3 It is fairly general you can apply it to any quantitative domain in science or engineering. How could we develop a global portable verifiable standard of technical ability? Institutional name brands are an expensive noisy signal. One idea is a repo with individually hand coded solutions to Project Euler like problems for multiple domains. For more than two centuries…the USA has stirred a very wide range of feelings in the rest of the world love amp hatred fear amp hope envy amp contempt awe amp anger. But there is one emotion that has never been directed towards the US until now pity. Already an American passport which once allowed easy access to almost every country in the world is no longer a valuable travel pass. Because of the coronavirus American tourists are banned from most of Europe Asia Africa Oceania and Latin America. That former aspiring Stanford or MIT computer scientist…isn’t just going to sit…waiting for the moment when they can enter the gilded halls of the U.S. of A. It’s the internet era…The frontier is closed here and it has moved elsewhere. You’re right. I think it’s more that the visual metaphor chosen doesn’t suggest the variety of different rankings people have. I don’t know the right visual but it might be more Tower of Babel than Tower of Culture at the present moment. By the way every item on the list with the partial exception of GTA is consuming rather than producing. It’s a 20th century broadcast state of mind. Culture as something you consume that’s fed to you. As opposed to something you do like lift weights or fly drones. For example if you take all the people who could understand the Feynman Lectures they could probably appreciate Hamlet. But not conversely. You could show this by exam or maybe Turing Test equivalent. So this imagined tower isn't even close. It's missing the cloud above. Interesting items for a v2 ranking The Feynman Lectures on Physics The Art of Computer Programming The smartest Twitter accounts and the dumbest Websites beyond TMZ GitHub Twitch 4Chan Legacy media outlets in 2020 where they are vs where they think they are You can't get away from ranking. Otherwise Google wouldn't exist. But this exercise shows these ranks to be very much in flux with important actors left completely off the map as well as any acknowledgment of how much individual disagreement there would be about ranks. This is remarkable on several levels. It's recent note the mention of Game of Thrones yet immediately archaic It has zero reference to math physics technology texts It ignores the descent of many formerly high institutions into clickbait Incredible meme potential. The cultural skyscraper as the new political compass. Glad we agree Can't express everything in one tweet of course but that was the sentiment. Good to see you working on modernizing India It's very new that an app built by 12 people can reach a billion while the nation that put a man on the moon can't ship a website control a disease or count votes. Legacy institutions built before the internet that haven't been aggressively modernized won't be competitive. gt isn't large and nimble gt small and nimble Sometimes often not. It's extremely hard to be large and nimble nowadays. And large and nimble might beat one small and nimble but often not 1000 of them. Any organization founded before the internet may not survive the internet. That includes many brick and mortar businesses. See next tweet Large and nimble gt small and legacy After decades of development our robotic future is finally happening. Flying drones legged dogs grasping hands talking androids. Don’t call it a comeback been here for years etc. Nice piece by . One remark I’d make is that these are baby CLI interfaces that don’t typically allow people to rm rf their files but do give people a taste of industrial strength computing. NLP has also become more packaged robust and reliable over the last decade. The basics like stemming amp NER work reasonably well out of the box. Now we can start leaning on them as subroutines to create works that wouldn’t have been possible without them. Btw I’m well aware that NLP techniques have been used under the hood of billions of search queries over the last twenty years. But explicit conscious invocation of NLP to add value to documents is new. It has been more subtle in Word amp Google Docs like better grammar checkers. A command line tool to automatically create tags in your text files for import into . It’s a group of young students so please be kind with feedback. The consumerization of natural language processing is beginning Maybe so. Don’t know how valuable those parts really are in terms of resale value. But any thief would be recorded and possibly face recognized which would be a deterrent. Yes a real dog may have the advantage in smell and taste. But in sight and hearing and certainly in memory and understanding of human directions Spot is probably far beyond any traditional dog. Spot has accessories by the way. And ports to plug stuff in. If these price points are real Boston Dynamics has a shot at completely owning the guard dogs market. There are many ways in which robot dogs are better than live dogs for this specific purpose. Unkillable remote controllable networked equipped with video amp microphone etc. If you look at most tweets people are scared of this thing. Of course they would be It’s headless and moves kinda weird. Classic uncanny valley. But a degree of fear is the property many want in a guard dog like a Doberman or Rottweiler. So security seems like the use case. Boston Dynamics seems to have raised only 37M. They will be at 35M in revenue if they can sell even 500 Spots at 75k a unit. Security patrol seems like the application that can justify the expense. Basically a mobile security camera with a whoa factor. Someone could instrument TikTok and run some experiments here. Maybe use a phone farm in case they actually have a UDID equivalent rather than a non persistent string like identifierForVendor . Today the tools we typically use to measure electrical and magnetic fields are themselves sophisticated pieces of gear with solid state components a kid couldn’t make at home. That’s not how things started out. For example Maxwell’s equations have far more impact if you first see exactly what Coulomb Ampere Faraday et al were working with. What exactly did their experiments look like? What data did they collect? What did their articles look like? Then you appreciate Maxwell’s leap. What I want is a VR exhibit of every major discovery in science. Put on the headset and walk through a digital museum. See Faraday discover electromagnetic induction and watch the Wrights invent flight. See the apparatus they used the experiment in 3D and then the equations. It’s handling hundreds of billions today. Imagine if the state actually worked with technology rather than against it. In fact we don’t need to imagine. You don’t have to think they are the good guys to realize they are way ahead in some areas. Yeah that’s why it has to be something like a hardware wallet or equivalent writing to a decentralized database like IPFS or a blockchain. The cryptography and consensus algorithms guard against many single machine issues including bit flips. gt There is a chain of custody then involving police officers and sworn judges These are agents of the state that have suffered reduced trust. The fundamental issue is that not enough people trust the state to count votes properly. Hence personal digital audits via private key. If an outlet published dangerously inaccurate early COVID 19 coverage like don’t wear masks or just the flu and did not retract on their own you know they have no self correction mechanism and can safely ignore. Immoral clickfarms that will publish anything for a buck. The ideal business model would incentivize corrections at least as prominent as the original article to all readers of the original. With software we push bug fixes immediately. One issue of course is that bad software doesn’t work at all but bad ideas are more abstract The lack of coronavirus retractions shows that Vox Media can’t stop worshipping fakeness Absolutely amazing that they and other orgs still haven’t formally retracted the early coverage. Ethically bankrupt media corporations incapable of reform. Need to build something better. Yeah I’m familiar. Harder to get a bug like that if you use a hardware wallet or equivalent to vote and record everything on chain. A bit flip on one machine wouldn’t pass consensus. Moreover you start with local elections then build success amp fix then move to national. After the current insanity ends perhaps at some point in 2040 the post apocalyptic US will turn to tiny Estonia by then probably 50 years ahead and ask it for guidance like Deng did from LKY. We’re already past that point with 40 mail in ballots this election. This is the last area of society to modernize and the most resistant. Every other service is online. Billions of dollars are sent every day electronically and securely but we can’t get this right Blockchains show that we can get to global consensus on contentious votes with private keys and public verification. After the predictable train crash in November people will start to argue that it’s not democracy if it’s not digital. It’s possible. But that has to be weighed against the problems caused by delayed mail in paper ballots without publicly auditable links to individual human beings. Enough people do not trust the counting process that it needs to be far more transparent amp individually auditable.   A we should be able to vote online B no many experts say it can’t be secured and paper ballots are actually less risky C well paper ballots may cause a slow motion train crash in this election so what about private keys personally auditable votes like Estonia? Figure out how to build a new ship. Other societies like Estonia Dubai Singapore and yes China modernized their legacy institutions. The decision of the East Coast establishment to resist technology rather than modernize will be the subject of 1000 histories. And it’s so much more than social media. It’s not just about small vs large. It’s about nimble vs legacy too. Small and nimble? Digital native. Large and nimble? Digital unicorn. Small and legacy? Dying in 2020 unfortunately. Large and legacy? Dying in 2020 painfully. The internet makes small organizations far stronger and large organizations far weaker. Instagram shows how much you can get done with a few aligned people. And the government shows how little you can get done with millions of disaligned people. The stock market isn’t the right measure of economic health. The distribution of citizen net worth would be far better. Similarly we need to start thinking about health holistically with life expectancy dashboards for different demographics. This is one area where people of many different stripes agree. Bank bailouts amp quantitative easing represent the upward redistribution of wealth as per Cantillon . Note that DCEP itself may or may not be blockchain based. had a good thread on it. Perhaps we should think of it as just a major upgrade of China’s financial infrastructure to be developer first with first class payment APIs accounts etc. But that’s still big. As and both note this is a big shift in coverage. In theory you can separate centralized blockchain and decentralized crypto but in practice this seems to be laying the groundwork for rollout of the Chinese DCEP the new digital renminbi. Write an update as a GitHub or GitLab paper Good ideas here involving journals as GitHub repositories. Every paper a subdirectory anonymous peer review via anonymous pull requests editors as admins code as the primary artifact. Every sufficiently large commit log does have horror mystery and comedy. The big thing about any idea like this is making the authoring flow as easy as it currently is and ideally easier. For example you could take something like JANE and run it over all the text in your buffer to auto suggest references. Or libraries. Academics spend a lot of time on citations. What if all these reference managers like and could be turned into software libraries? The next version of BibTex might treat citations as code not text. Yes. The thing about math is that an unproven but plausible assertion is termed a conjecture. Not a theorem. If you turn more citations into import statements you could go further towards identifying the number of truly independent replications of a scientific assertion. Great term. The next step after reproducible research may be composable research. Perhaps you fund 100 people at say 10k each to make their existing work composable. Start with or an outlet that is already aligned with these ideas. In the same way that good code can be often used without reading the manual a good scientific paper can often be boiled down to a few key assertions. CS is the most obvious place to start. Each journal a code repository each paper a library? from nips import smith.2017 If we take reproducible research in the sciences seriously the paper is a human readable adjunct to the code and data. The main conclusions of many scientific papers should be expressible as equations API calls or entries in a probabilistic knowledge graph A binds to B . How many academic citations can we replace with import statements? The Yahoo index didn't scale to the whole web. But maybe it doesn't have to. Maybe what you really want are digital monasteries in which a specific community curates links from a given area. Like Wikipedia Yahoo 1.0 social network. Roam is one place to try this. Github too. Note also this doesn't need to be Ethereum based. It'd be fun to see if one of the newer chains could support this more easily. By issuing free tokens on a new chian it's also a good testnet like thing to play around with wallets familiarize with block explorers etc. The fact that this is expressly for fun and essentially the on chain version of StackOverflow karma or badges should make development much faster. Only the admin user pays and only to manage the SaaS dashboard amp pay for gas costs of creating contract sending tokens etc. How might this work? Mostly a SaaS app Standard Django for most of the app including billing logins etc But the sheet state is written to the blockchain And user's fiat credit card buys enough crypto to pay for the writes eg buying enough ETH to pay for gas Note that you don't need all of a spreadsheet's functionality. It might in fact be a fixed template with two sheets All historical transactions All current balances Undos would be in red font. You might add an option to disable undos and go to production mode . Wanted a blockchain based spreadsheet for quickly creating a new token or NFT issuing it to people in your community tracking awards to specified wallets and logging history. Not an ICO as it's not sold. Just issue a token for fun. Like on chain karma or badges. Static analysis Dynamic analysis Formal verification? Perhaps the next generation of blockchains will require developers to run formal verification prior to writing an updated smart contract to the chain. Continuous verification as the new continuous integration. The Remembrance Agent RA is a program which augments human memory by displaying a list of documents which might be relevant to the user's current context. Unlike most information retrieval systems the RA runs continuously without user intervention. I'm very sorry to hear about your loss Venkat. The internet has spread American culture and the English language to large swaths of the world. What if we pushed back on that somewhat? After all American society isn't much to emulate anymore. The technology is. Can we factor the tech part out and model healthier cultures? Immigrant parents might offer the following deal to kids play any video game you want so long as it's in your mother tongue . Bake translation into single player games as a way to preserve cultures. RPGs in particular have plenty of text to read and conversations to have. Technocultural preservation 3D scan historical areas and record volunteers speaking in their mother tongues. Then deliver an immersive VR experience. Children might be able to learn any language from good enough NPCs particularly if their behavior is programmatically pedagogic. Probably if the ceiling is low enough. But probably not before they get a good visual written to the cloud. True sci fi would be mapping that to face recognition and a microphone like in the Devil's Advocate. Call out the burglar's name in a deep robot voice. Dystopia beckons Here's the new LG PuriCare face mask. With two H13 HEPA filters dual fans respiratory sensor and rechargeable battery it's the state of the art in post apocalyptic outerware as you traverse untrusted zones. Protection from smoke SARSCov2 surveillance. Here's the new Ring security drone. Rather than N fixed cameras you have a single patrol drone that captures everything. Like a flying Roomba it'll only work indoors at first. But an outdoors version may follow if this is a hit. Here's the Spot robot dog by Boston Dynamics. It's available at 75 000 today. If they can sell even 1000 or so of them worldwide the price will likely come down over time. And it can be accessorized. America 2040 Twenty years of civil unrest have subsidized the widespread adoption of autonomous rottweilers and bald eagle drones. Never leave home without your unkillable robot companions which videotape every encounter and can be infinitely resurrected. Hire globally. Only hire above the mean of all employees. That's the Lake Wobegon strategy a way to increase the quality of an org as it grows. But it needs equity alignment or equivalent to incentivize people to recruit folks more skilled than them. Yeah something like this YouTube or podcast link gt gt transcript gt RoamNERd gt Roam In theosophy and anthroposophy the Akashic Chronicle is a compendium of all human events thoughts words emotions and intent ever to have occurred in the past present or future. Reproducible research is also a critical piece of the puzzle. New grad students can be onboarded by just recursively descending into function calls till they hit original citations. Jon Claerbout deserves some kind of prize for founding the discipline. Of relevance is this excellent post on how YouTube specifically and online video generally is enabling tacit knowledge transfer. Possible crossover event a group of fellows apply NLP to reanalyze a set of 100 books from a historical period. This could be the foundation for a new academia based on the decentralized quantitative study of the humanities. For example take all the books from a particular era of say Russian history. Digitize them upload them throw NLP at them translate them get indexes of people places concepts sentiments. Get time series get stats get a bird's eye view. Then annotate collectively. If we take the existing roamcult community build natural language processing tools into Roam and the open versions and start collectively reanalyzing historical periods amp great works of literature you could have a totally new generation of pseudonymous internet scholars. The idea of computational history has been around for a while but if you can just paste in a collection of related texts and a get all named entities b have them all linked together c get detailed stats on n grams and so on…that decentralizes commentary out of academia. Now we're talking. Excited for where this goes. Basic natural language processing techniques like named entity recognition can provide new windows on existing texts. A new era of decentralized commentary dawns. A bit confused. Of course no one should pay fees to companies if they can figure out a better alternative. That might mean coding their own exiting to another platform building a coalition with comparable economic leverage etc. Operative word is better though. Ideally ridesharing gets decentralized into a crypto protocol so that a all drivers get a share of the upside and b a single centralized corporate intermediary doesn't even exist. Will happen eventually may take 10 20 years. While the App Fairness folks have a good problem statement their vision page involves ten somewhat messy vague asks. Better to focus on one thing an eat what you kill policy which allows devs to bring their own cards amp rails. The App Fairness coalition might make a single ask from Apple. 1 If the user chooses an Apple ID associated payment method 30 to Apple 2 If instead the user logs into an account with a pre existing card or the dev implements their own rail no fee But that interpretation would also be text or some kind of multimedia and also thus hashable and storable on chain. So it would still work for narratives. They're just a layer up from pure machine readable raw data. If cryptocurrencies endure and if we can extend them to accommodate much more in the way of storage a future wannabe Stalin wouldn't be able to take down the proof that these inconvenient photos once existed without crashing the entire digital economy. As Orwell put it they who control the past control the future. And they who control the present control the past. But an undeletable digital history is outside of anyone's control. Which will make things like this impossible. We’re in the year 11 AG after the Genesis Block. Jan 3 2009 marks the true start of recorded history. in the sense of cryptographically verifiable digital history I'm not sure Ethereum is the place for it but a chain that integrated Metamath would be very cool. It would be interesting to put a Metamath proof verifier on the Ethereum chain. It would let anyone set pseudonymous rewards on mathematical proofs. By 2040 it's not true if it's not on chain. Every dataset every physical law derived from that dataset every paper explaining the derivation of that physical law and so on will eventually be on chain. If you're saying something is true you can now show your work. And must. Btw original image was from the famously lengthy Principia Mathematica. This is a good blog post that explains WHY it was so long. Short reason is that they didn't have some aspects of modern notation so had to copy paste code. After all formal verification is finally having its day in crypto. When it comes to smart contracts the stakes are large enough to make it worth bringing out the big guns. I invested in to help bring this math to market. Good overview here A blockchain is a collection of cryptographically verifiable assertions. As more kinds of facts get logged in the ledger of record we may be able to algorithmically reason our way to some interesting conclusions. Or this but unironically. Yeah. We need a synthesis. Be able to rebuild all past dependencies from scratch and then add a new layer. Without the ability to create the new there is stasis. Without the ability to recreate the old there is degeneration. This is cool but may gain more traction if adapted to be a frontend for smart contracts. Reason many smart contracts do accept arguments but current block explorers don't have a great UX for inputting them. So this could make crypto more accessible. What this suggests is that the civilizational equivalent of being able to code from scratch is more important than realized. It's not enough to simply push a button. We need to be able to rebuild from scratch simply to continue as a civilization else maintenance is impossible. Cargo culture That's the perfect term actually. Cargo cult culture. We think we have capabilities that we really don't because we repeat what our ancestors said without being able to write something worthy of them let alone surpass them. It's the difference between stock amp flow. If new books aren't being written in a language if new people aren't being trained in manufacturing the flow has been cut off. The culture that surrounds us is then just the stock and it's being depleted without anyone to replenish it. This is a microeconomic explanation for how Idiocracy happens slowly. You think the cultural capacity is there because the artifacts are all around. But the culture producers are actually slowly vanishing and their descendants can only repeat not create. This is similar to partial bilingualism the ability to understand a language but not speak or write it. Common among children of immigrants. If children can't write the scripts of the parents if their access to ancestral culture is read only that culture won't be replicated. Read only culture Suppose you were raised in a religious household but didn't practice yourself. Growing up with these civilizational scripts means you can recognize them perhaps repeat them but cannot write them from scratch let alone explain them. So too for a society. These next gen block explorers are pretty cool. They show what you can do with other types of data on chain besides just transactions. Visualizing price data on chain by Visualizing spatial data on chain by Company is Quilt Data Here's the link to their search engine This is pretty sweet Search engine for public S3 datasets with built in visualization tools and links to Python Notebooks. Great place to learn how to parse genomic or crypto data for example. A more complex advocate may take a price oracle feed do some calculations and render the results as charts in an article. Importantly if published via reproducible research a reader could individually verify every assertion drilling all the way down to raw on chain entries. Oracles and Advocates. The simplest oracles are the feeds of cryptographically verifiable financial data which are already being put on chain. The simplest advocates are posts that cite these oracles by directly linking block explorer entries. Example The rise of crypto oracles means we can eventually factor many academic papers and articles alike into a feeds of cryptographically verifiable data and b a reproducible research style narrative layer on top. In theory by 2030 2040 or whenever open state databases eg blockchains IPFS can scale to internet scale workloads you might simulate the privacy impact of an action prior to executing it. See second part of this talk There were many implicit privacy assumptions in the pre internet world starting with the premise that either a you were friendly with most of the folks you walked by in a small town or b you were de facto pseudonymous to most of the folks you walked by in a big city. Basically we uploaded the entire world in unencrypted form to the internet. Now we need to encrypt it again. Sort of like Jane Jacobs for the digital world. Restore shade privacy structure community. Once we moved from the trusted internet of academia to the untrusted internet of the 90s we introduced SSH HTTPS and other encrypted protocols. Perhaps the next step is to start encrypting names. Go from John Smith to johnsmith.eth to foobar91.eth and fizzbuzz32.eth. People are adopting search resistant identities. Treating their real names like social security numbers gradually doing less with them online only using them in official contexts. We may see the Google Facebook Twitter era of unencrypted real names online as anachronistic. Great piece by on what the pseudonymous economy might feel like in a few years. I have a feeling that the current period of being able to find information about random people online without their consent will go away. It's all encrypted identities by 2040. Network effects on datasets arise when you can join them together. Ignoring heterochromatin due to difficulty in mapping cloning or assembling these sequences excluded upwards of 10 of the genome from these initial drafts Now twenty years later we are finally able to fill in the blanks. If we treated ideas like we treat software we'd push updates to all readers when there was a correction to a piece. proposes the same concept how do we reach people we've misled…mass direct messaging to everyone who shared or fav’d a tweet Nationalist monotheist Internationalist polytheist Decentralist atheist Assuming no inflation every voluntary exchange is already zero sum with respect to money and positive sum with respect to wealth. The question is what of the economy is still engaged in wealth creation. As happened with farming robots may make this a smaller than we think. Like Oracle's incentives for Postgres adoption the local government is very thoughtful in helping companies quantify the cost of continuing with their current service provider. Bay Area government finally getting behind technology in a big way Extremely farsighted and selfless move strongly incentivizing remote work and the decentralization of tech out of the Bay Area. Note that he announced on Instagram. Even the tech CEO who owns a giant media corporation decided to go direct rather than be mediated and potentially distorted. This is becoming standard. Bezos is opening up a network of free preschools. First one in Washington State. Is that right? I'd always read that he used a water clock. Will check it out. More precisely an accumulation of phenomenological laws and empirical data collected over many years gave the raw material for Newton and Maxwell to put together their syntheses. The equations are clean amp deterministic but the process of getting there involved messy data. The laws of motion are often conceptualized as deterministic equations but they too were inferred from data. All that nostalgia for idealized visions of the 1990s or the 1950s or whatever historical period but in video game form. Hollywood set designers have already done a lot of the work. Need a tool to scan period films and upload 3D models of all clothes and objects. VR will make it possible for people to live in previous time periods. Also we know that millions of new people are becoming investors. Crypto amp Robinhood make that obvious. The main q is whether this stays a part time hobby or becomes a more common full time job. Social is about 10 years ahead of fintech crypto and gives something of a clue gt Unless you just put your money in a fund and let other people manage it. And that option is available to everyone. Choosing a fund manager may be a little like choosing the CEO of the company you're working at. Except you could diversify and also manage some yourself. One response is someone still has to do the jobs. But the share of farming jobs crashed even as the population rose because we got really efficient. Perhaps robotics similarly reduces manufacturing share. And then perhaps investing becomes the main post manufacturing thing. This was my initial thought process too. But robotics is getting really good and if the cost of robots is just electricity and parts then that means capital can substitute for labor. Perhaps if you are a bad investor you just invest in good fund managers. Similar to picking a CEO when choosing a job. Of course you can always strike out on your own or diversify. Exactly. As robotics expands into more areas the cost of labor becomes electricity which is the cost of capital. So dialing up a factory is eventually just capital allocation. Yes. Relatedly imagine if all this money went towards people building up equity stakes rather than paying down debt Put another way could someone choose to substitute their capital for their own labor? Something that informs my view is the state of robotics. It's getting good and in 10 20 years electricity capital may substitute for much manual labor. What does adaptation look like? I agree that some forms of finance are transaction costs like ATM or wire fees. Other forms like startup investment create or scale new businesses which are an engine of economic growth. In a sense working a job is investment of labor rather than capital. Can we substitute? That's true. But there is a solution for that which is to follow a fund manager and give them a slice in return for allocating your capital. It's similar to picking a CEO when joining a company. Except you can diversify more. Yeah that's reasonable. Everyone has a day job and some people tweet or invest. That's where I started too. But maybe we are underestimating the endpoint of the current transition. We've increased the number of investors by 100X. Maybe that has huge consequences. Not sure yet. Universal Basic Index basically. Like a basic income in some respects but with the added element of skin in the game. By default reinvest and compound at the societal rate to pay for robot rental. In this world capital allocation becomes the job robots find hardest to do. I'm still developing thoughts here but just as a thought experiment What if all of society was by default invested in the equivalent of an index fund and the dividends from economic growth provided the basic income ? You can opt out and take more risk but at your option. In this hypothetical world everyone is micro investing every day the 10000 micro exit is kind of like the viral tweet what would have been college money seeds your fund picking a fund manager is like picking an employer robotics gives a low scarcity basic lifestyle Many bemoan the financialization of the economy. But perhaps we lean into that. Perhaps investing is what people do in a robotic economy if they don't want to be founders. Investing is similar to consumption. Just click to buy. Picking is hard. But you can join a rolling fund One way of measuring this what percentage of income do people derive from investments vs wage labor? We think of wage labor for a salary as the default today but the transition from farming to manufacturing was a big change. An improvement in some respects and not in others. Farming was the 1800s. Manufacturing was the 1900s. Counterintuitively could investing become the most common job of the 2000s? Reason crypto and fintech are turning everyone into an investor just like the internet turned everyone into publishers. How far does that go? That's true but the detectors seem fairly expensive to set up which is similar to mining or staking farming etc . Yeah but while we can engineer higher speed blockchains we can't change the speed of pulsars. Still they may be useful for some applications. What's the cost of setting up a detector? No. If you want to die that's your prerogative but please leave everyone else out of it Universal health care isn't enough we need eternal life. Figure out the science then make it inexpensive amp universally available. Ideally a pill. Opt out if you want of course. gt Those who create life extension technologies will be profit driven People who built smartphones were and are profit driven. This resulted in billions of poor people getting phones. Similarly to maximize profit from reversing aging you make it available to everyone. Moreover because life expectancy is a ratio scale variable like height we can measure it reliably across space and time. By contrast the poverty line changes over time for various reasons. So it's harder to agree on what eradication would mean. It's actually the opposite. If we had a cheap treatment that could reverse aging amp restore youth not only would this crash healthcare costs it would give people many more earning years in the prime of their lives. Finite life expectancy is the root of scarcity amp hence poverty. Who are you? Tony says. The new guy looks crestfallen. Greg Ritchie he says. Then when no one seems to react he jogs their memory. President of the United States. If you read the essay you'll see that the measures you mention poverty inequality etc ultimately stem from scarcity of resources. That scarcity arises because we have a finite number of hours on earth. Remove that limit and remove scarcity. All the measures you mention are economic metrics that are ultimately subsidiary to quality of life. Historically an important measure of the latter is in terms of life expectancy. No because that means N different servers by N different educational institutions each of which can go and will go and has gone offline or change formats. A blockchain or something like IPFS provides a single point of truth a common file format and total uptime. Where you'd probably start this though is with financial data. Every archival data point currently accessible via the Bloomberg Terminal but on chain. A number of NBER type papers could then be turned into Jupyter notebooks where everything could be reproduced by hitting enter. That last step posting raw data points directly on chain with digital signatures rather than merely putting aggregates online via a state agency site might seem like a small thing but it would allow for total independent reproducibility by pulling all data from a chain. Covidtracking is one of the best projects I've ever seen in terms of data integrity. If you go just one step further though you could double click on say 1000 cases reported by a given state to see 37 hospitals in that state each posting individual data points on chain. For example goes to admirable lengths to show data provenance. You can track back each case to individual state agencies. But you can't track it back to the very origin which is a hospital reporting the data to the state. If every data point was on chain you could accompany it with proof of X Proof of who who made the measurement Proof of when it was made at this time or earlier Proof of where where it was made And so on A chain of custody for individual data points on chain. Premises Many papers are based on datasets Those datasets are rollups of individual data points like measurements on an individual The datasets and sometimes the raw data points are currently in silos like NCBI or Bloomberg But you could put them on chain If you combine reproducible research cryptographic proof of X and federated analytics you can envision a world where every paper isn't just reproducible but where every row of data is logged on chain with all relevant proof of Xs to demonstrate data integrity. Someone should set up a site like Scott Aaronson's Complexity Zoo but with all the proof of X papers and code. How many bits of randomness can you generate from pulsars in this fashion? A related question is whether the pulsar noise is random enough to pass various tests eg like Marsaglia's DIEHARD battery but more modern ones . I found this cite on the topic So if I understand correctly it's similar to using the block header hash of the next Bitcoin block as a random number generator. It's not known to anyone in advance it's confirmable to everyone after the fact and it's globally accessible without man in the middle issues. The idea of using pulsars as a globally available retroactively verifiable random number generator is interesting. I need to understand more about how you'd acquire the signal cheaply. But you could imagine each frame being hashed with that info and continuously uploaded. Can you explain exactly how the pulsar signal would be acquired in your model? Would it be just a new sensor in modern smartphones or something else? Yes but freedom is still valuable. And will be valued on the other side of this transition. Free speech free markets free thought free trade freedom of contract freedom of movement freedom of association…all of these freedoms and more are being abrogated. We'll need to safeguard protect and restore them with encryption. Not naively rely on legacy institutions. It's going to have to be the cloud of the free. The land of the free may be over for some time. I understand the sentiment here but the global internet will continue. It will just need to be based on decentralized encrypted protocols. With distraction it's even harder. Many businesses today rely upon social media as a distribution channel. Every company is now a media company. Yet with all the competition for attention social media is like the handicap radio from Harrison Bergeron. With competition you might have some rule like wait before three customers mention this competitor before taking them seriously . Though that may mean you react too late it means you only react to likely real things. In many ways it's like angel investing with your time. It's hard because these are 95 rules not 100 rules. You usually want to be aware of what the competition is doing but run your own game. Yet sometimes that isn't possible. Similarly with distraction. Ignoring the competition is just level one. The real task for founders today is ignoring the distraction. Note that China itself has been protectionist in this fashion. Setting up a company there often meant setting up a joint venture with Chinese nationals. Or getting your company banned. But the precedent may be contagious to Europe and other locales. Second order consequences. For better or worse we have deprecated the previous era where US tech companies were the free speech wing of the free speech party and the US championed free trade worldwide. Now it all shifts gradually to encrypted protocols. I like the ideas behind but my understanding is that they depend on a set of trusted beacons right? So it doesn’t use existing hardware. Let me know if off base. I think it’s now easier to rebut at scale. It was easy to fake at scale back then Mr. Jones is well worth watching. Shows that the problems of official misinformation we’re dealing with have been around for generations well before there were social networks or messaging apps You might do something where the challenge depends on a private key being available. That would be something the real node may be hesitant to copy over to a VPN. And if so the extra real node to VPN latency might cause it to fail the challenges. What about VPNs? These are tricky for distance based methods because you’re remote controlling a computer with some latency that actually is physically in the claimed region. You might make the challenge depend on a private key which you wouldn’t want to copy to the VPN node. That is indeed a way to spoof location that’s hard to overcome by a distance based method because you are remote controlling a computer that is actually physically in the claimed place. Finally it goes without saying that ping times are a highly imperfect measure of physical distance. They can rise for reasons like network congestion that have nothing to do with a node moving further away. Nevertheless they are lower bounded by the speed of light. Incentives TBD but roughly speaking you’d want to incentivize nodes that had high uptime reliable locations and the compute to issue and pass many challenges. And you’d want to slash or penalize nodes that spoofed their location. This is a form of independent verification. If you introduce probes with known to you locations that issue challenges to other nodes and yet the reported location of other nodes doesn’t change that’s good evidence the protocol is working. Importantly if you ran an organization you could put your own servers on the network with fully trusted and known locations. And you could prioritize the response to their challenges when looking for nodes with spoofed locations. So you might not get a guaranteed location out of it. But you might get something like this node was close enough to stationary servers operated by different entities to pass many challenges over this time interval meaning it was likely within this coordinate ball. Some nodes in the network would be stationary while others would be phones or tablets. The protocol wouldn’t be hardcoded to trust any particular node but stationary servers run by organizations like Pingdom or PagerDuty could accumulate many location confirmations over time. A node that claims to be at a given x y location at time t will get many challenges from other nodes that report being near to it at time t. It’s incentivized to solve and return these challenges as quickly as possible such that compute time is small relative to ping time. For a pair of nodes with reported locations the speed of light gives a lower bound on how quickly info can go back amp forth. Obviously network topology can dramatically change ping times. But a node should be able to solve more challenges more quickly from nodes it’s nearer to. Specifically suppose you have N nodes each of which is reporting a time varying position x t y t over a time interval with M time steps. Any node which purports to be near another node can be challenged by an equation that it must solve amp return as quickly as possible. With respect to proof of location you can’t naively use GPS because it can be spoofed. You might go with trusted towers of known location but that’s centralized. Another approach may be to assume K of N nodes are honest reporters of GPS and use speed of light as a constraint. I'm agnostic on any given decision here but I do recognize that overwhelming demand for block space is a good signal for the sector. Early internet companies needed to minimize bandwidth just like early crypto projects need to minimize on chain traffic. But bandwidth and chain capacity both increase with time. Fee pressure is painful but good in the long run. It leads to technical innovation within Ethereum eg zk rollups and migration to other chains. A financial incentive to scale and decentralize. No single measure is ever perfect but it's similar to exponential backoff. You raise the cost of certain kinds of actions. It's also possible to vary the price by locale which Twitter does know to first order though this can be spoofed with a bit of effort . A simple expedient might be to keep account creation free but add a green check for a 5 paid account. You might then allow everyone to read but only green checks to comment on posts. That's almost as messy as crawling because 1 the Referer field can be faked or left empty 2 the global state of who has what backlink is still fragmented across server logs 3 the backlink isn't updated at creation time but rather click time which is very different Yeah. The next step is a zero knowledge version. Crypto domain names integrate usernames pseudonyms websites payments messaging encryption hosting reputation discovery login and more. Fun thread. Also gets at a deep point. Internet communities share digital worlds but not physical environments. Engagement and value add beyond just the content itself. Updating books for the digital environment rethinking them now that we're 20 years in. A Kindle is just putting a book online. What does the digitally native version look like? Yes Great idea. Value added curation basically. A genre that should be more common on the internet. We do see this for listicles and device reviews. But could do more with it. There have been a few apps that do this but I haven't seen a really fast way of sketching on your tablet and instantly seeing it on your desktop. It'd have to be as fast as opening the camera and somehow context aware. Probably doable if tablet and laptop are on the same wifi. Yeah. One of the first things to build with the Roam API should be an importer to index old notes from orgmode Evernote and the like. You might be able to preview that in a separate graph before adding it to your main or keep it separate . I'm familiar with the area actually. Many years ago we coded a biomedical search engine based in part on supervised learning to infer ontological relationships. Set up the whole thing as a large imbalanced logistic regression. Roam solves that in part. It's like what Google Knol wanted to be a Wikipedia with property rights. So it's not a trustless environment. You are viewing the NLP index on the dataset curated by the person or group with admin rights to a particular Roam graph. gt how do you deal with spam and adversarial docs That's one of the cool things about this. You are only doing this on published books. So the underlying dataset is way cleaner than the web. Curation workload is also manageable because there are only say 1000 books on a topic. Dublin Core is useful for metadata on individual citations like an electronic card catalog but you may need domain specific ontologies to do proper NER for text on say the Great Depression or cancer genomics. If this adds enough value perhaps the next generation of authors will open source their books load them into Roam encourage annotation updates interaction and monetize by charging for the community rather than the content. You want to do this for one time period to debug the NER and demonstrate the value proposition. As you add genres you'll need to address new difficulties eg Unicode . Once it works for all old books then extend to Sci Hub amp Kindle? See related tweet Idea the next Google Books 1 Take a collection of books from Project Gutenberg or Google Books on a given time period 2 Apply Named Entity Recognition to build a cross book NLP index 3 Load this into a public Roam graph 4 View what N books have to say about a given event Doing that for one book would be interesting. It'd be fascinating if done for a curated collection of books that all talk about the same events places people. A new kind of index a cross book NLP index. Different from web search because the underlying dataset is much cleaner. Do you have a demo Roam page where you can show how well it works? Another concept is that we may want to distribute a block explorer with a wallet as a part of the client software. The block explorer is the desktop application which allows the user to view what's happening on chain. Or it's a piece of such an application. The concept of crowdchoice how the internet will permit collective bargaining with governments. I had a discussion on this with and a while back that did a great write up of here The basic idea is that CBC is much easier to design for than pure P2P. With pure P2P problems like discovery indexing or contentious global state eg leaderboards become difficult. There are workarounds like magnet links. But also failures like this In the CBC model clients often read and sometimes write to a central blockchain. Writes are costly and cost coins. One tricky part is that there are also other nodes miners stakers farmers that host the B of the CBC. But using an existing public chain may obviate this. CBC client blockchain client An alternative paradigm where every client has a local crypto wallet some coins and a local relational DB. It leans on a central blockchain to find other clients and route messages to them. The local relational DB is used to cache amp index state. MVC model view controller dominant paradigm for web apps. You have an ORM on top of a relational database the model that processes commands from users the controller to render requests the view . An important corollary is that blockchains can be part of a protocol rather than the whole thing. Many protocol designs become easier if you can assume that all peers read and write to the same global database. From MVC to CBC client blockchain client? Looks easy to try python3 roamNER v1.py Would be awesome to be able to specify arguments at the CLI to run this in batch and also to package this up. Then remove Roam's upload limitations amp hook it to the Roam API. Finally make it part of Roam. I decided to try and make a working implementation of Named Entity Recognition in Roam. The upsides of this are enormous being able to instantly cross reference ideas from any written content is huge for researchers students hackers of all stripes. gt thought an index wouldn't scale Yes. That was true. It was and remains a gigantic undertaking to crawl the web and build that index at Google. But by 2030 2040 or so open state databases may scale to provide a public realtime Common Crawl like index. A fundamental new primitive that blockchains offer for protocol design is tamper resistant global shared state. Why weren't bidirectional links part of the original web? Because you need global shared state. If A links to B at time t how does B know about it? A could message B. Or A and B can both be indexed by C. C was Google. Now it's also Roam et al. Eventually it will be on chain. Grep and the like are too slow because they're doing linear scans. They aren't an index. Slack isn't the same because it's just a messaging app. More comparable are orgmode Notion Evernote and other note taking tools. Roam optimizes for a certain kind of PhD like brain. Just merge the pages by renaming one of them to the other. It'll update every position where one is mentioned. This is useful if you have multiple names for the same thing john johnsmith John Smith and so on . No because if you have 100k words of old notes you still need to identify what to tag in the first place. You can do something like cat notes.txt tr n sort uniq c sort k1 rn less to get a word histogram but named entity recognition can do better. It defaults to daily notes to encourage you to write on a daily basis but you can build out individual pages as well. It's less work than a wiki because it does a lot of auto suggesting. Once you define a new tag which you can do with one character foo at your convenience you can go back and click a few times to link any or all past occurrences of that tag. People often name bidirectional links as the core concept behind but it's more like semantic annotation of text. Next step would be to make this even more automatic. Ideally paste in text get automatic tag recommendations and then manually approve. Some common questions You can use either foo or foo to designate a page You can collapse john and JohnSmith into one page You can autodetect old mentions of foo You can build up tags for people places ideas You can in theory link these tags across repos One tweet summary of . Type a sentence like Had meeting with JohnSmith about defi You get a page with all meetings meeting a page with all mentions of a person JohnSmith a page with all mentions of a concept defi It indexes your text. If a roamcult member wants to try this I’d love to see what some basic Named Entity Recognition applied to a corpus can do. Can you automatically ingest a bunch of text files identify recurring important entities and define backlinks pages accordingly? I liked ’s idea of 280 character email limits. Or something like Discord where there was a rate limit on how many new emails could be sent in a given time period. Maybe it’ll take crypto to innovate on new messaging protocols. Well in the event the US has a contested election as seems likely the Bush Gore 2000 outcome of having the Supreme Court decide may now be off the table. With a 4 4 deadlock does the confirmation decide the election? There are various arguments from different sides to shut down international tech platforms. The emergent result though it’s never called that is internet censorship. This is why it all moves over time to encrypted protocols. People speak somewhat ruefully and somewhat jokingly about the before times but does appear that pre 2020 will be thought of as a different world. The year the old order ended and the year the Internet truly began. So if you were born in 1981 1982 for example you were literally the last graduating class to finish college without social media being part of the experience. The Oregon Trail Generation remembers the world before the Internet. The Generation remembers the world before 2020. Crypto is similar. Non college origin. But it didn't spread in tech amp media but rather in tech amp finance . So it's still underrated in media amp youth circles as it doesn't solve problems for them yet. It also skews older than people think because crypto starts with investing. Excellent troll. Taking the premise seriously Twitter had a different base than Facebook or Snapchat. It wasn't a college phenomenon initially. It spread among 20 30 somethings in SF amp NY in tech amp media. That early cohort gained many followers and is still influential. This is interesting. Conscious consumption of time. Even more interesting if every app could display that number when you tap it. One vision of the ideal app is the one that gives you maximum benefit for minimum time invested. Learn a skill or earn money in five minutes. Why is Twitter memoryless? Everyone must drop everything to focus on today’s most important thing. That means forgetting yesterday’s most important thing. The ledger of record promises to radically expand the scope of mathematically verifiable facts. And thereby reduce the impact of MITM’d science. Most people aren’t consciously using computers for computing. More for storing things digitally and looking them up. But we could. Anything that can be reduced to a series of mathematical operations can now be independently reproduced on billions of phones laptops and tablets. Like having your own cloud chamber or inclined plane at home. Yes they have done very well. Satya has led an incredible turnaround. Jobsian in terms of value accrued at least but less flashy and in some ways more difficult didn’t have founder level legitimacy to change things . You could only vote for algorithms no one can update anymore. Those that have reached their final state. Tricky but in theory possible Algorithmic governance. Already happening in crypto to some extent in the sense that people are voting with their wallets for smart contracts. An algorithm makes truly binding campaign promises and is fully transparent. It will do what you say not always what you mean It’s not Microsoft in general it’s and his team Seven Billion Netizens. Bet on the internet bet on decentralization bet on crypto bet on encryption. Over the long term these will prove to have the most enduring global constituency despite the coming age of national balkanization. Neither an American Century nor a Chinese Century but an Internet Century. It’s hard to get a monopoly on anything. If they manage to get a VR headset to scale someone else will create the Android to their iPhone. Oculus Quest is amazing. Oculus Quest 2 looks to be even more amazing and is coming out in October. Facebook somehow got really good at hardware. There are also bad actors on the internet. That doesn’t mean we ban the internet. If India bans programmable money it will set back an entire generation. Meanwhile China is building a blockchain powered city Looks like the purported Indian crypto ban may be exaggerated. That said the time to speak is now before any law is proposed An Indian crypto ban would be like an Indian internet ban. Guaranteed to put Bharat behind. The time zones of the world. Some interesting spreadsheets to make What is the distribution of world population across time zones? What about in 3 hours from that time zone? What is the distribution of tech clusters and unicorns? How does time zone overlap with other criteria like rule of law? This page lists all the countries of the world grouped by time zone. Synchronous remote is indeed much easier than asynchronous remote. Though you can hire night owls or early birds in other locations remote teams are partitioned by time zone. A good complement to the course A list of the most important recent AI papers. For remote Americans this may mean Canada and Central South America get a second look. Also an opportunity for well positioned cruise ships once COVID is over. One edit to this companies will pay to keep teams in the same timezone for synchronous communication. I’m not the first to observe this but historically humanity was organized by latitude. Remote might reorganize the world by longitude. With gt 50 of waking hours spent in front of a screen much more of people's daily experiences become amenable to cryptographic verification. Everything that passes in front of you on a screen was at least stored on a computer if not generated there. Science is how we understand the natural world. But math is perhaps even more useful in the constructed digital worlds that we spend more and more of our time in. This suggests that we want to reduce as many assertions as possible to mathematical rather than merely scientific statements. There's actually much that can be done here using NLP public datasets reproducible research and the ledger of record concept. Normally we don't think of math and science as being in tension. But it is true that math gt science gt religion in terms of rigor and reproducibility. Billions of phones means anyone can now independently reproduce any mathematical statement. But not all scientific ones. Math is harder to MITM than science. Mathematical claims can be independently reproduced on anyone's computer while hard to reproduce science has to be taken on faith. As such we should reduce as much as possible to hashed timestamped verifiable math. From 2013. No scientific law prevents 100 people who find each other on the internet from coming together for a month or 1 000 from coming together for a year. As that increases to 10 000 and beyond we may begin to see cloud cities materialize out of thin air. No incentive no consensus. In many not all places where the word decentralized appears we can profitably replace it with the term community to give a different perspective. Centralized hosting is corporate hosting decentralized hosting is community hosting. Decentralized hosting is community hosting. The one upside of a widely accepted but false premise is that by clearing it away you can often unlock new mathematics and science. Fundamental falsehoods are true opportunities. Mathematics teaches you that there are statements which are intuitive plausible and false. Today you can hit enter and make just about anything happen in the cloud. How far can we take that in the physical world with construction drones delivery robots and autonomy?

Note that even this reference to Jurassic Park depends on Hollywood itself. If you recall the scene from Jurassic Park where they splice in amphibian DNA to spackle over the gaps that's similar to what media consumption has done to your brain. The gaps in your knowledge have been filled in by TV and movies. These are unreliable narrators One other note the ledger of the record may be the only way to re establish common truths across different tribes and countries. On chain posts are for the record posts. A higher level of polish than merely putting something online. See also If you think it might be important some day you need to post it on chain not simply online. Posting it on chain is like entering it into the Congressional Record or having it notarized except it's at a much higher level of confidence than that. Basically blockchain or gtfo. Is that right? Would love to see if you have a link. 4 The concept can be generalized. Current blockchains give reliable proof of who via digital signature what via hash when via timestamp . Proof of location would add where. Other proofs would extend the scope of the ledger of record. And allow querying on other axes. Typo Merkle root 3 Some on chain video would be public while much would be encrypted and hence private . But simply having this spatiotemporal on chain index would enable anyone to formulate a query message the authors and pay in crypto for footage of an event from multiple angles. Caveats 1 Hashing content wouldn't prove the footage was real. However it would show that the footage existed at this time amp was posted by this entity. 2 Many efficiency improvements are possible. For example you could hash every frame amp periodically post the Merkel root. On chain video search Imagine a crypto camera that posted a timestamped signed hash of content on chain. If you also had proof of location you could do a spatio temporal query for all on the record footage in a given x y z t range. The immediate followup is how many contentious statements can really be adjudicated this way? Right now it works for crypto. Eventually that means all of finance. Then as more of our world becomes digital more of it becomes hashable and timestampable and thus provable. This is the promise of the ledger of record. Anyone can independently confirm statements made on social media by inspecting a blockchain. PostgreSQL specifically and open source databases generally for quite a while now.

Could be a useful teaching tool for example Cloud first land last. But not land never. Could be a faster way to turn an internal tool used by engineers into something the company as a whole can use. Even if the CLI's arguments are untyped you don't need to modify code either. Define an external file that maps options and arguments to input fields. CLI to UX Idea given a command line program with explicitly typed arguments it should be possible to autogenerate a simple localhost based web UX. Map a text argument to a text field a date to a date picker and so on. Has anyone done this? Incredible visual metaphor. As the physical world fails the digital world offers a seeming workaround. It restores the vision that state failure took away. But ultimately we still need to breathe. Digital exit is a temporary respite a tactic but not the answer on its own. Why is there more creative work for a tech company than an open source project though? A big project like Django or Ethereum is as complex as a tech company. Maybe it's because the customers are the creators so there is less market research no sales process etc? Hm. Is that true or is it that open source projects tend to be CLI driven and so what you're creatively collaborating on is text vs images and so that's easier to work on remotely? If can identify the active ingredient here that might help with remoting existing cos. This is also a good response. Open source often becomes corporate sponsored with offices once it reaches a certain level of traction. Still it's typically remote first and highly distributed. That's true but does that map to remote vs in person? You can collaborate on a frontend remotely just like you can on a backend via Figma or equivalent. Though maybe a command line interface IS easier to remotely collaborate on as it's pure text? open source is for and by software engineers who are most comfortable with remote first yet there are many in person tech companies building dev tools open source would be even better if it could fund office space but why can it be good at all if in person is needed? Some possible reasons open source is a hobby so quality doesn't have to be as high but there are high quality open source projects open source is all volunteer so management isn't the same but there are certainly manager style decisions for merging PRs Open source projects tend to be remote first simply because there is no budget for an office. Why does this seem to work for open source to a greater extent than for tech companies? I think we need to rethink these for remote. Twitter shows remote serendipity is possible. Video games and social networks are the native form of remote socializing rather than Zoom coffees. In person will always have value but it's also expensive. It'll vary but I think the pattern will be 1 Start remote first or in a small group somewhere in the world 2 Optionally pick an office somewhere when you get your Series A That is colocation will be a conscious decision. Remote first reduces burn in early stages. Observation there isn't a single remote Schelling Point like Linux that everyone can contribute to. No open source Zoom due to hosting and bandwidth. Maybe there's room for something which is to Zoom what GitLab is to GitHub? Perhaps it has a different form. Remote first will rapidly improve. All major tech companies and countless startups are working on this every hour of every day. The ultimate dogfooding. Twitter is actually v1 of serendipitous remote interaction. A polite Twitter replacement would be a breakthrough.

It's Technology. Tech is now remote first. Moving to the Bay Area is no longer necessary. And outages fires prices and dysfunction are driving out the people already there. The place is less appropriate as a metonym for the concept. This is not to say these companies are evil. They have created valuable services that do difficult things hosting broadcast etc . And in the 2000s and early 2010s the free aspect was huge. But now it’s time to renegotiate the social media contract. Crypto is key here. Relatedly a 3.50 CPM for Twitter means a million view tweet earns roughly 3500 for Twitter. Views are private while likes RTs are public. But you could estimate the correlation for any individual. And estimate how much they have made for Twitter vs how much they have seen. At 10 CPM 2B views is indeed 20M in revenue. That’s not net of course but you might get gross margin from public statements. Just publishing a spreadsheet with these calculations may start pushing folks to decentralized media. Money is the simplest way to quantify this but you may also only want to view posts that make you take positive actions in the real world. Lift weights run eat better write your article push your code. Proof of work to post amp to view. Buy time from others by adding value. As attention becomes more scarce and crypto advances you’ll eventually be paid for a larger fraction of the posts you read. Going from 0 to gt 0 changes psychology. You start thinking about viewing posts that have some material benefit to you vs say making you mad . By the way for quite a few people foreign students these two processes already coincide. So it’s not THAT new an idea. But would be newly mainstream in some countries. You could stick with your default country the one you were born in. Much like in state tuition for state schools. Or you could try to go somewhere much further away. No right answers but it puts a new twist on leaving your home at the age of majority to learn something new . Imagine if 18 year olds filled out country applications rather than college applications. Anything we’re doing through a phone will involve sensors and actuators. On the sensor side I can see us getting farther with pure imaging. But many techniques still require molbio for sample prep eg sequencing . On the actuator side I don’t see any way out of using molbio. Some argue that caffeine enabled the industrial revolution. This sort of feels like an OS level thing. Right now we have lots of apps messages and todos floating around but the context is entirely on the user to put them together. Even something as simple as you usually open these two apps together could be inferred from the OS log. A v0 might just be defining a list of apps Gmail Terminal etc and then assigning them as icons to each task as you create it. Then you can sort todos by app context and execute a bit more mindlessly. That would also create training data. Could you actually do this? The AI would have to read your mind in a sense. But given a database of many completed tasks it might learn that send note to X meant opening up an email while calculate Y involves a quick spreadsheet. A sufficiently smart todo list wouldn’t just let you check off items. It would open up exactly the apps you need to complete the task and no more. Did we? I think the internet has boosted productivity dramatically in some respects but also increased distraction for many. I’m amazed when I think about how productive earlier authors were without word processors internet version control. Are we focus limited now? Tech has focused on attracting your attention. It now needs to devote attention to restoring your focus. People’s mental models of distant times and places. Of industries they haven’t participated in and of professions they haven’t worked in themselves. They know on some level that Hollywood isn’t real but they don’t know what is. If you haven’t studied something in depth your mental model of it often implicitly reduces to a few scenes from a Hollywood movie. Original post Apple’s ARKit is now quite good. Viewing with a phone is unwieldy though so I expect AR glasses eventually. Thesis the only citizens that explicitly sign a social contract are immigrants. From a reader I spent an unusual amount of time on social media this weekend as I had a successful tweet going viral within FinTwit. Below is my daily resting heart rate pattern. No other change to exercise or diet. You can clearly see the spike. The Compromise of 1877 was an unwritten deal informally arranged among U.S. Congressmen that settled the intensely disputed 1876 presidential election. Perhaps humans can just get addicted to feeling righteously angry like they can to sugar or alcohol or nicotine. If so this is a superstimulus we need to identify and consciously limit in our information diets. Has anyone studied whether wearables can detect changes in heart rate or blood pressure from viewing social media? Perhaps if we could see what it’s doing to us we might use it less. I don’t think I ever said that? Perhaps you are thinking of or someone else. I don’t recall ever giving trading advice. This banger brought to you by well known technological progressive .

AI video editing is getting very good. Hollywood at home. Ah. I think the point is to eventually innovate in the physical world again. But we will have to go digital first for a while. Btw this is a very recent phenomenon. In 1990 for example you couldn’t live on the internet . It was maybe barely doable in some US regions in the year 2000 and more so but still hard in 2010. Now digital America is everywhere because the Internet is everywhere. Consider the following choices 1 physical America digital America 2 physical America only but no Internet 3 digital America only but not being physically in US Thesis less people would rank 2 above 3 today. Which means much of the US value prop has moved to the cloud. Over the last few decades a significant part of the value proposition of being physically present in America has been digitized. COVID and remote have accelerated the digital and further reduced the value of the physical. The cloud is becoming primary the land a parameter. Suppose we view it as Physical America vs Digital America. Seen from this axis much of the physical world is locking up amp malfunctioning. Meanwhile people migrate to the digital world because things just work there. Given the alternative you pick the digital alternative. Yeah but in that essay you will note that I distinguish detailed technical concepts from trivial ideas. A well written fusion energy blog is something in between a full nuclear engineering textbook and an offhand comment. It would educate and inspire action. It doesn’t come out of the entrepreneur’s stake. It is a referral bonus the investor gives to the author. Same logic as all advertising lead gen and content marketing. Investor pays for referrals that convert. Except magnitude and time scale are qualitatively different. It’s screen time vs earth time cloud time vs land time. More than 65 of respondents spend gt 50 of their time looking at a screen. We’ve quietly all mass immigrated to this thing called the Internet from our home countries. At least we spend half our time there. Virtual reality amp virtual currency can make this more than a metaphor. One part of this is certainly the whole Russian bot thing. But another underappreciated factor is the extent to which non American English speakers simply by virtue of posting amp upvoting on social media influence the US culturally as well as politically. Yes been true for some time. Non Americans don’t have a vote but they do have an upvote. That said Atom style custom keymaps would be awesome to do at some point to obviate the issue I see Conor had the same thought These keybindings are standard in many editors including TextEdit Google Docs and Terminal itself.

Wait you’re saying social media corporations and media corporations may have incentives that are not completely aligned with the population at large and the health of the republic? The Great Acceleration? Crypto is to cryptography and distributed systems groups what AI is to stats and machine learning groups. The sudden attachment of a monetization engine to academic research accelerates progress and turns professors into founders and executives. When you put it online you get distribution sharing collaboration etc. When you put it on chain you get immutability verifiability monetization etc. On chain is not suitable for everything just like you don’t put everything online. But it may actually be broadly useful. On disk Online On chain On chain is like the third level of deployment. Files that only you care about stay on local disk. Files that are important to others get put online. And files that are really important to others get put on chain. Yeah. Hard to educate people about that in time but one can try. Perhaps the ideal might be to report no intermediate counts until they are all counted. If the 20 point swing towards mail order ballots described in this video is real that dwarfs every other factor. It’s like COVID 19 in January. We can see it coming. An election without a universally acknowledged winner is now a likely eventuality. First 3D printed drugs have actually already been FDA approved The printer lays down thin sheets of powdered medication and droplets of water based fluid bind these layers together at a microscopic level. Also this may go without saying but we’ll want some pseudonymity zero knowledge based version of the login process to protect financial privacy. First we can get it to work with toy apps though. Btw defi is a multi year thing. There will be ebbs amp flows as with everything in crypto. It’s quite possible that the current boom crashes hard. Or that the login system happens on another chain. But Login with Crypto will happen. Many forces pushing in that direction. Ethereum names will be the new Facebook accounts. There's an initial killer app to get people to sign up. For FB it was collegiate social networking. For Ethereum it's defi. Then you get decentralized single sign on for the crypto ecosystem. Log in with Ethereum. That would be an interesting next step to allow users to filter a feed by proof of economic alignment. For every article you read you can determine if the authors are on your side in a cryptographically provable way. Only works if they hold crypto If social markets become the new social media and crypto turns a billion people into investors then fast but accurate information becomes key. If you're basing financial decisions upon information you want those providing that information to show proof of economic alignment. Great point So all commercial real estate becomes like datacenter space? An Amazon warehouse is like an e commerce datacenter A cloud kitchen is like a food datacenter A clinical lab is like a bio datacenter All become robot driven facilities with nondescript exteriors. Love this. 24 hours a day x 7 billion people on the planet. To paraphrase Rutherford physics is sensors and actuators. All the rest is computer science. Yes this is a joke. Yes of course physics underpins computers. But for those people living in a constructed digital reality the impact of physical constraints boils down to I O. This is a startup strategy but it's more than that. It's a way to think about every institution. How can you turn it into a computer brain with sensors to sense the physical world and actuators to act upon it? See also Manna from Marshall Brain The Internet Age is just beginning. Of course analog to digital amp digital to analog converters are important. They are our sensors amp actuators. But everything should be thought of as happening on the computer first. That's the primary form. The physical world just a printout. Eventually virtual real estate via crypto domains. The Internet age is just beginning Money spent on commercial real estate starts migrating to virtual estate. You're not talking about a mere ad you're talking about paying top dollar to be at the top of the UX As important as physical location once was In a sense this isn't new. Social feeds have been around a while. But what's new is the deprecation of the 20th century economy thanks to COVID. As every restaurant moves to the cloud their position within Uber Eats amp DoorDash's UX is the new downtown. As every restaurant and legacy business moves online commercial real estate matters less. The new location location location is position position position. Everything is about your position in the feed. Put another way to feel that things were getting better over a 20 year period the improvements to your personal and societal utility need to be worth being 20 years older. This is not impossible but is a fairly high bar. It's certainly possible for things to get quantifiably worse. But you could factor utility into at least two terms personal utility and societal utility. As someone ages personal utility declines. So other factors would have to rise dramatically to compensate. To what extent do people idealize the past because they were younger then? Social markets as the new social media. Bitcoin Centrist is a good play on words. Centrist as in the center of the space to give BTC its due. Centrist also as neither a nocoiner nor a maximalist. It’s also literally true that at a one person startup the founder CEO is the lowest paid employee. Is there a crypto angle? Yes and a Mastodon angle. The ability to come to consensus on a single number in an adversarial environment like a vote count or an upvote count is a necessary and perhaps sufficient condition to establish trust at scale. Context Stalin reportedly said those who vote decide nothing those who count the votes decide everything . Apocryphal but might be rooted in fact see below . What we didn't anticipate is a society where you couldn't even properly count the votes Those who vote decide nothing. Those who count the votes decide everything. But those who can’t count the votes can’t decide anything. I’m not sure if anything can be done at this late stage of the game. But future historians may point to the cause and effect between COVID 19 and this outcome if it occurs. Everything went remote to varying extents but we weren’t ready for a remote election. Here's the full article. The analysis is by a Democratic group but the numbers are non partisan. Hawkfish CEO comes across as a sober citizen trying to raise a warning about a plausible outcome. This doesn’t even strike me as sci fi or implausible. This seems to be the outcome we are barreling towards. Because the claimed 20 point swing to mail in voting can be measured now. If real it is larger than any other likely swing. This is a concerning and plausible scenario for how a contested election happens. The apparent winner on Election Day could be reversed by record numbers of late arriving mail in ballots. Both sides then cry fraud. For the people who don’t get this a number of billionaire CEOs have come out of middle class beginnings via the YCombinator incubator. During that period they typically earn far less than market rate and want to become ramen profitable . YCombinator? The Internet. If you can make it there you can make it anywhere. Once you really nail the analog to digital interface and its reverse and commoditize the hardware as has happened to once magical microphones telephones printers monitors etc then the entire game happens on the internet. Win there then press enter to win in real life. Of course the analog to digital and digital to analog interfaces are nontrivial. Genome sequencing VR headsets digital currency 3D printers this gets the offline stuff online and vice versa. But once it’s online we’re off to the races. What I like about your book is that it squares with a lot of thought on why it’s most powerful to do things Internet first . Build it in the cloud then hit enter to materialize it. A printer a 3D printer a drone flying at your command a robot hand People often prefer constructed realities because they are more interesting more fast paced. Wait years for a real tree to grow or see it sprout in seconds on a screen? Related to ’s thesis An interesting visual metaphor is to think of a viral idea as being like a fast growing plant. You can imagine a VR environment where one day everyone is just walking around and the next day these gigantic viral redwoods have sprouted up around everyone’s house. The printing press is arguably part of this. Bible and novels. It’s all on the continuum. As tech and media advance more of our daily lives are taken over by interesting human constructed environments like Twitter as opposed to physical realities. The next step is VR. What’s in common among people who imagine they can reconstruct a distant past who are deluded about the US present who have visions of a better future? They are all focused on the virtual realities depicted on screens. So we are the unreality based community. Having spent a lot of time thinking about virtual reality and virtual currency I thought virtual everything was relatively new. But a huge insight of this book is that we’re continuing on the deep cultural track laid down by Hollywood and the Transcendentalists before them. Bruno’s thesis is that America is increasingly becoming a virtual society focused on make believe above all. I have to agree. This novel vantage point unifies many otherwise opposed schools of thought. Fantasies of the past delusions about the present visions of the future. The Founders Fund manifesto makes the case that tech has slowed down or reversed. 1 Transportation top speeds have fallen since Concorde was retired 2 Drugs costs for drug approval have skyrocketed 3 Energy real costs of energy have also soared That’s a good correction. It’s not my site but may be able to update it. One major issue we don’t have an unambiguous metric for progress. So people can argue metrics. However if you must pick one we can make a strong case for life expectancy. In that arena progress was exponential but has more recently decelerated and even reversed. Good thread and important discussion. It’s tacitly building off Thiel and Cowen on the Great Stagnation. But we should engage the counterargument which is The first believes they are building a genuinely beneficial product not hawking some flim flam religion. The second believes they are building a genuinely important movement not hawking some flim flam company. Let the market decide I’m pitching something in their individual self interest not some kind of moral precept. My conscience is clear. The will of the people I’m advocating a moral precept not something in their individual self interest. My conscience is clear. When the sale gets high stakes enough and you are pitching a senior executive and this could be a politician or general as much as a business leader then the economic and ideological cases often overlap. Let the market decide vs the will of the people These two philosophies reach an interesting limit in the case of sales where one person’s will is how the market decides. The internet gives us information and productivity but also distraction and procrastination. Tynker is a kid’s app which integrates coding into the game. Maybe these are also coding competitions and companies play to see who has the best competition programmers? I really wonder if companies could somehow play each other for real stakes or to settle disputes somehow. Maybe a charity purse. One version is companies playing against their competitors in an e sports league. Sort of like Ford playing GM in baseball except it’s Google vs Facebook in DotA. The rise of crypto domain names VR NFTs and remote work means the Internet century is actually just beginning. Extremely impressive review of the latest in virtual estate. Wait till the billions of dollars we were wasting on San Francisco real estate is spent on VR offices. Corporate budgets for social networks and video games have yet to be unlocked. Wait till the billions of dollars we were wasting on San Francisco real estate is spent on VR offices. and I discussed this in the before times. If you want remote socialization for your company you can 1 invent new remote rituals amp hope they catch on 2 repurpose the polished social apps amp games maintained by multibillion dollar companies that your whole team knows Remote work we know. Remote play is social networks and video games. They weren’t built with remote in mind. But they are more organic than doing artificial Zoom coffees with the team. Investing is now remote first too. But how do you build the relationship if you can’t meet in person? Well investors are actually more accessible online. You can hang out with them on social networks and sometimes video games. No scheduling needed way easier than coffee. A somewhat counterintuitive point you don't need that large a following to bootstrap a new product. Even a few thousand folks is enough to start testing out ideas. The upper limit of your company size is determined by how large that community may be in 10 years not today. People will often debate whether team product or market wins. In the influencer first approach the community helps define all three. It creates the market articulates the problem and pre identifies at least one credible team member in the persona of the influencer. Founding influencer is now on par with founding engineer. An influencer with an organic community can identify a problem pair with a technologist crowdfund a solution and continuously communicate progress along the way. The community derisks the process of market discovery. You can 3D print a drone. Yeah. Feels like Google has gotten worse for old queries in particular. I'm also more excited about datasets like Common Crawl which helped enable GPT 3 and might enable more innovation in search. This is very different from the dotcom crash. These are fairly healthy companies paying to get out of SF. In summary Don't come to SF for tech Do get out of SF if you can Big numbers outweigh anecdotes More companies will follow We're finally decentralizing technology. I think the transhumanism vs anarcho primitivism axis while weird seeming actually surfaces deep underlying differences that are usually unarticulated. For example is technological civilization on balance good or bad? This debate was held at Stanford in 2014. Full video here Zerzan encourages everyone to give up civilization and go back to a hunter gatherer lifestyle. And I encourage everyone to do more to speed up technological and scientific progress. It was a meeting of polar opposite views Zoltan vs Zerzan. If you think through the underlying motivations of our needs they all turn back to keeping ourselves and our species alive. Now that we have technology should we not try to add a layer on top of the existing pyramid of needs and shoot for figuring out life extension? No. I think China may show how far people can push control. But the encrypted Internet will hopefully show how far we can push freedom. The legal dimension may be smart contracts. Let's see how far we can push blockchains by 2030 2040. The physical dimension may be materialization into startup cities. As for jurisdiction there's already a process for turning unincorporated land into a city in many countries. With the Internet we have the possibility of building something more egalitarian than America. Billions of people won't become US citizens. But they are Internet users. Can we use that to deliver not just information but jobs rule of law even digital citizenship like Estonia? Put another way America's decline is often paired with China's rise. But the CCP system isn't globally attractive in the same way the US system is or was. The Internet however is globally attractive. To Americans and Chinese alike and more besides. The truly counterintuitive point of view is that the American century is over but the Internet century has just begun. The ideal is to found these startup cities on bare land filming the entire process with an explicit memorandum of understanding with the host government. Songdo is an interesting precedent. In what sense is the Internet the successor to America? With virtual reality and virtual currency the digital frontier becomes more than a metaphor. Gather in online communities with mutually agreed upon governance. Eventually crowdfund to materialize cities in physical space. Machine translation may soon connect the world. We could see a step function jump like GPT 3. But perhaps we also want machine obfuscation. Imagine opt in software which flagged scissor statements that could split your community and disemvoweled them. Like a language barrier. For example anything that's popular on American social media may be filtered by the app. Or it automatically detects scissor statements via NLP amp downranks them. These are just ideas. It could be simple no English no US based posters or complex. But it would be different. Sharechat is an interesting Indian app whose innovation is keeping English out. This simple firebreak keeps the US cultural goliath out and gives local cultures room to share. Perhaps you could do a different twist on this which filters out American social network craziness. The purpose of a startup city is to do something you can't do in a legacy city. It makes tons of sense on paper. However while remote spokes are doable meaning individual contributors remote hubs are hard meaning managers . The reason is that so much of management is reading emotions going for walks eating lunch together keeping people happy. As remote first becomes the default expect colocation to become a more frequent term. As in we started remote and colocated after our Series A . He's absolutely right about the benefits of face to face. The question is whether the costs exceed the benefits in 2020 in the Bay Area specifically and then more generally. Maybe the new convention is that you start remote and partially colocate at your Series A. Remote first is now the default. It's the cheapest fastest and most flexible. An office is still valuable but it's a premium upgrade. Good discussion. There's still benefit to colocation because remote doesn't capture every aspect of collaboration and VR isn't at scale yet. But 1 Important open source projects have been fully remote for a while 2 And colocation need not mean colocating in SF CA USA Great video by on Tuft Prof Michael Levin’s research. Bioelectricity hasn’t received that much popular attention but there’s quite a lot of experimental evidence in amphibians in particular that shows how important it is. Full video here It may be possible to regenerate human limbs. Indeed The current model is very paperwork intensive up front but then doesn’t enforce any ongoing security guarantees. A crypto model might be interesting. and Oasis are working on this. A billion genomes. With homomorphic encryption secure multiparty computation or the like to permit privacy preserving decentralized studies outside academia. Opt in to studies with one click become participant rather than patient share to see your results. We’ll get there. gt startups have not been a meaningful durable constraint on industry practices many stakeholders dislike Substack Bitcoin Ethereum Signal Stripe These are off the top of my head may need long form to discuss further. I guess we’d have to define terms. Are you saying startups don’t take significant market share that the big five will still be as dominant in ten years or what? COVID in the US won’t be done for a while because a chunk of the population won’t take a vaccine. Moreover this is an extinction event for local businesses. And so much else. It won’t just pop back up. It’ll be very different afterwards. Two other magnets that brought people to the Bay Area are also being virtualized. 1 Investing continues to move online with AngelList rolling funds Zoom VC and the resurgence of crypto. 2 And Stanford Berkeley are moving to remote instruction for at least a year. This is healthy overall. Many in SF wanted tech gone. They are getting their wish. Tech in turn is finally fully decentralizing and cutting the last obligate ties to the land. Making everything remote means tech can be anywhere. And build startup cities in the middle of nowhere. San Francisco as the de facto capital of tech is done. That time and place is over. There’s no point in moving there for tech the businesses are shut down and people aren’t meeting up. It’s all internet now for a while. And relocation to towns and cities around the world. 1000 startups are collectively very formidable competition. Instagram Snapchat Oculus WhatsApp TikTok were all startups. Individually any one may fail but together they force either an acquisition thus funding more startups or reform disruption. But it’s actually really hard to get acquired. For every one you read about there are N that didn’t make it. And it is those acquisitions in nontrivial part that fuel the competition as they fill the coffers of investors and founders and encourage more competitors. I actually agree with many of the criticisms regarding privacy and centralization of power but we’ve seen what state regulation looks like. It looks like GDPR. It’s not competent or surgical or effective. Startups amp crypto protocols are a different approach to reform. This is probably the core philosophical difference. We think of startups as the ultimate form of constructive criticism and of tech giants as vulnerable. We also think the state is not competent see SF CA US . Reform is welcome regulation just strengthens incumbents. We’re getting closer to high fidelity VR. Putting something on chain is a stronger version of putting it online. You blunt the impact of link rot stealth editing downtime format obsolescence firewalls and many related issues. That will likely be accomplished via following mechanisms. Anyone can invest on their own or invest in funds investors with proven track records. The latter is similar to Twitter following. Important thread. It is a bit of a delayed reaction but the age of international American media dominance is coming to a close. Part of this is because the US is now just less aspirational to people abroad. We will see more media in local languages and cultures. Crypto also changes the feedback loops for investing from 10 years to essentially real time. This has downsides but it will mean every portfolio is always liquid and marked to market. That’s important for bringing even more capital into the space. Founders amp funders are a two sided market. An influx on one side is accompanied by a rise in economic leverage for the other side and then a corresponding influx into that side and so on. More investors higher valuations more founders more competition lower valuations. It’s easier to fund than to found. Though not easy to do well. All the talk about capital abundance will be more viscerally understood as the number of investors rises. Eventually we get a billion crypto investors. And we all see the extent to which progress is founder limited. We need to once again lean into the radically egalitarian nature of the original internet. All nodes are created equal. There is someone in India Nigeria Venezuela who is a better investor than most of the folks on Sand Hill or Wall Street. Crypto gives them the chance to rise. Technologically you could build the Coinbase Twitter mashup today in which every user does casual pseudonymous microinvesting and tracks their progress on a public leaderboard. It may take a generation for crypto people to fill the relevant regulatory and policy roles though. We will have a billion VCs by 2040. Just like the internet turned everyone into publishers crypto will turn everyone into investors. We’re now developing many societal alternatives to college as we know it. Before college? startup gap year During college? online ed After college or instead of college? ISAs These kinds of reforms will persist even after the pandemic abates. GPT 3 shows that chatbots were a good idea just a few years too early. GPT 3 should update your mental model here. Take a look at the various demos based on it. Once all work is remote work then every interaction with a coworker is over an internet connection. So an AI can drop right in there alongside everyone else. Slack bots and scheduling AIs like Clara are v1 of this. What’s v2? If you watch a lecturer writing math seeing them actually write it out gives you insight into the order of operations in their head. Even if you don’t see it written in real time a diagram often reduces a graph to its absolute essentials. You can reproduce it from memory. People may be averse to winning against totally fake bots though video games like World of Warcraft argue otherwise . But AI judges would change that dynamic. They’d grade your posts like Simon Cowell amp give you feedback. Might even help produce useful code and writing. I wonder if you reposition this as AI judges. So the algorithm is now transparent. This judge gives you a public upvote based on feature X you posted at the right time . And this other one gives a public upvote based on feature Y your post has an interesting visual . It’s already here. You could also imagine this in reverse. A social network where every comment is filtered for whether an AI could have produced it. If it’s a low context low signal reply especially if negative it’s filtered out. A reverse Turing Test for humans. The bar rises over time The Botnet app is a really interesting concept. Turing capable NPCs may be a way to break the gamification of social networks and restore a more Dunbar number like world. Everyone a king so no one is? I wonder how immersive one could make the illusion. Full Westworld. Give those NPCs phone numbers and emails too. Make them respond with voice and text like humans. We have trillions of social media posts as training data. You don’t see most people in person anymore anyway We have algorithmic feeds on TikTok AI influencers on Instagram and first class bots on Telegram. But we haven’t seen a social network that leans into all of this and just populates the whole thing with hyperrealistic NPCs. Video games have done this though. MMT isn’t logical on its face. It does have a higher logic though which is that it represents the unlimited government. Like BTC ppl the MMT folks correctly apprehend that money printing is the core of state power. They take this in a very different direction though gt were more severe We don’t have the counterfactual the parallel economy. The common take in crypto is that gold BTC economies have more corrections but not Great Depressions. Trying to iron all of the volatility out of the system by fiat sets you up for a gigantic crash. The fundamental critique we have of macro is that it’s been hard to run controlled experiments. Outside of capitalism vs communism at least. Crypto completely changes that. It allows opt in economies with real money and new policies. Finally some alternatives and experiments. Well I am glad we can run the experiment. The mainstream view is that moderate inflation is good as it spurs consumption and escapes liquidity traps. The crypto view is that hyperdeflation is good that it incentivizes saving and reflects real progress in reduction of prices. He is expected to outline what could be the central bank’s most active efforts ever to spur inflation It will work in some domains first better than others. Probably text to images. Search implies the thing you’re looking for must already exist. Generation implies only that you must be able to imagine it. What if search is replaced with procedural generation? As in type in what you actually want and it generates the whole thing for you. The big breakthrough may be when this is bundled with Tweetdeck style software. It’s not just bots anymore. It’s normal users using this to pump up the likes for their posts. AI suggested content. More dopamine superstimulus. Whole thing may become even more kaleidoscopic. AI may eventually break social networks. Algorithms churn out beautiful Instagram scenes that few humans can match. In response networks may adopt crypto verification. Or people may just scale back to the Dunbar number of folks they know in person. Btw what this suggests is that a city state populated from the cloud and underpinned by a crypto REIT in which every resident was a shareholder would do extremely well. Interesting. That’s a take on the Eastern Roman Empire I hadn’t heard before. Yes Invision Wordpress Gitlab are three that come to mind. Many more nowadays. Many have observed this but a lot of the conversation around SF or NY is between folks who think of these cities as mainly a base of operations vs those who think of them as part of their identity. The former make coolly dispassionate analyses that make the latter heated. Some people get all nationalistic about their cities. Others about their countries. Still others about their companies. And yet others about their cryptocurrencies. It would be funny if someone cited this graph for why NYC will come back. Rome also came back It just took 1000 years and it wasn’t the capital of a global empire anymore. By the way haven’t seen anyone connect decentralized finance with New York’s decline. But it’s another major factor. The global financial capital is moving onto the Internet now. Note SF is also declining as are many major US cities. Urbanization is in retreat. Twitter is remote and produces more serendipitous meetings than many large cities. This is by way of saying that I think Seinfeld is wrong here about whether NYC will fully bounce back. It’s interesting that he brings up London and Rome as examples. They were once the most important cities of globe spanning empires. Now they are not. There are downsides to remote but there are also huge upsides especially around cost convenience and commute. In person is still valuable but now it’s a premium good. We’re in a remote default world now. Yeah. It’s just an interesting question I think to revisit all these older protocols with new crypto tools and ask if we can do something better. For example staking rather than SPF DKIM for email reputation. Machine translation may get really good this decade. Imagine a step function similar to GPT 3 or the recent rise in remote work. The latter was catalyzed by corona but the tools also needed to be there. Right. Neither China nor the current USA but the Decentralized Networks of the Internet as the globally dominant power of the 21st century. It’s both as obvious and non obvious as the rise of the USA was in 1914. This is one thesis at least. The rise of the Liminal Anglosphere is particularly interesting. India Nigeria Israel Singapore the Philippines and English speakers around the world now outnumber the Anglosphere of the US Canada Australia New Zealand. And the latter did envelop and succeed the UK. From the United States of America to the Decentralized Networks of the Internet. Most haven’t yet thought about cross network peering arrangements as being similar to interstate compacts. But there are many analogies particularly for crypto networks. The Internet will be to America what America was to Europe. A frontier that ultimately succeeds its progenitor. It’s not a common suffix unlike .com Here’s his followup from 2017. Remember when put his life savings into Bitcoin at a blended price of less than 10 BTC in 2011? People mocked him for years. He’s now up gt 1000X. Bitcoin is strong. Strong enough to shrug off countless attacks while in its infancy. Strong enough to ascend the commanding heights of finance in its adolescence. Strong enough to become the center of the entire system as it rises to adulthood. How to make crypto domains resolve in browsers prior to general support? If issuing then get or the gTLD for .xyz or both. And redirect. Right now .eth uses for this purpose. But that is less intuitive. TMI too much information This is used in a joking way when you learn something about someone that you didn’t want to know. But it applies more broadly to all the personal info on the internet. We can start using crypto domain names as pseudonyms to start rebuilding boundaries. We are entering the real future. VR is so much more convenient for graduates all around the country or all around the world. Incredible graph. Fits data from other sources. Sell city buy country. Before corona. First part holds up well. Now for the second The wisdom of crowds seems to apply in some cases. You can survey people to estimate the number of jellybeans in a jar. But you can’t survey them to estimate the gravitational constant. It’s too far beyond people’s daily experience. Something we take for granted is that when executives inside a company have a disagreement they don’t typically take it to Twitter to polarize the customer base into opposing factions. There are often more productive and positive sum ways to settle a dispute. When does involving the general public improve a decision? It can be helpful when gauging market demand or popularity. Issues that impact the public’s buying decisions. But it’s not useful for determining say the composition of an alloy. Basically over the last thirty years we bulk imported the real world into the internet. But the physics are different here. And laws rules and norms haven’t adapted. We need to re establish all of that. Thesis we are in an intermediate era where you can easily google strangers and find out what they look like. What’s coming is a hall of mirrors of AI avatars and virtual reality. On the other side by 2050 or so you may not know what distant people look like anymore. Worth distinguishing between pseudonymity vs anonymity though. Pseudonymity is Reddit anonymity is 4chan. The latter is a den of iniquity. The former can be civil. On balance I think it’s a more stable internet if everyone is default pseudonymous. I think it takes 10 20 yrs. Bruno is one of a few people in the world of letters who gets what decentralized truth really means. Argument from cryptography defeats argument from authority over the next 10 20 years. The network as the next Leviathan. Btw graph at the top is from Eran Segal’s group. Future historians may note that this was the era of sugar caffeine opioids and social media. Just like previous eras were in part driven by nicotine and alcohol. Maybe there’s always a dominant drug of the age even if we don’t see it. We have physiological data that shows the effect of nutritional diet on metabolism. You can see the glucose spike after a cookie. Do we have graphs that show the effect of information diet on neurology? Can we see the dopamine spike after a tweet? Body language is interesting. It’s not typed out and people often don’t even know they’re doing it or reacting to it. VR may start to get us here. There is research on transmitting facial expressions too. Yes there is something about context busting and scale. But there are also many large accounts who are constantly angry. You may be onto something. If you showed the number of friends or values in common in the reply UX would that change behavior? For some people it was once novel to be able to yell at random strangers online. But it’s much less novel in 2020. Indeed it’s the default state of affairs thanks to likes and upvotes. And so online insanity has created a demand for online and offline civility. I used to wonder why people were so much ruder on Twitter than real life. Then 2020 happened and Twitter became real life. Now I think we’ll need a new social network that models physical world levels of civility. Rebuild civilization online first then offline. India is the dark horse of this decade. Increasingly using DuckDuckGo for search. Privacy preserving less thumb on the scale. There was a time when Google was magical. It would nail these queries for really arcane technical topics. Can’t remember the last time it felt like that. Hard to find old content for example. We’re not that far off if you think about Unity and the state of game engines. And people are logging into Oculus Quest with their Facebook accounts. The procedural content generation part is still hard though. Maybe GPT 3 and sequels can move us beyond branching dialogue? The programmatic protagonist a movie where you are the hero and the screenplay is auto generated from content you’ve liked. Moral principles have no logical limits. Only pragmatic ones. By 202X it’s all AI avatars and crypto pseudonyms. Real name considered harmful. Public blockchains aren’t just open source they’re open state amp open execution. A glass box where you can trace every read amp write made by every algorithm. They provide a new way to design internet services without relying upon centralized corporations. This piece is better than most in that it engages with the tech but misses the point. A public blockchain is a massively multiclient database where every user is a root user. As opposed to a few privileged sysadmins at a social network or bank. Right now seems like we have a few options 1 Write your own chain from scratch 2 Write a new client like btcd or parity and add non consensus breaking features 3 Fork an existing chain 4 Do a smart contract on an existing chain 5 Use a framework like Cosmos What else? That was where I started too. Systems programming is hard real money security harder. But with so many new protocols being developed there are some common features. Cosmos has tried abstracting out many pieces. Maybe it’s the first blockchain framework but not the last. Well crypto has arguably made it easier to start a digital bank than a lemonade stand. There are also gradations a smart contract isn’t a full protocol like Ethereum but it’s not a conventional CRUD app either. And web dev used to mean much lower level programming. Oh I know. But many of these protocols were developed before modern systems programming languages and frameworks. Could you reimplement them with far fewer LOC using well chosen abstractions? We do have reference implementations to check against. Sort of. Cosmos’ SDK is closer to what I was thinking of. But ideally it would be a framework that uses the same abstractions to let you code both older protocols NTP SMTP etc and newer crypto protocols with native performance unit tests etc. Cosmos is a good step towards this. But can we do more? A protocol typically can’t tolerate the same amount of overhead as a web app so it wouldn’t be the same approach as in most web frameworks. Maybe something in Rust and or involving code generation. How can we make protocol development as easy as web development? Folks this is my friend Max Hodak President of Neuralink which is building actual brain machine interfaces. Cofounder is a lil’ guy called Elon Musk. If you are a citizen journalist with a tech background who can sling around an equation reply to Max to see if you’re a fit. At some price most markets clear. Moreover you can at your discretion import reputation from other systems. I have some posts on zero knowledge transfer of karma between HD wallet accounts. Look at ENS names. All the infrastructure for portable reputation is finally being created and will likely get built out during the rise of DeFi. Crypto allows for capitalism without corporations. So it dramatically changes the balance of power. I think that Uber had to be centralized to iterate amp nail the frontend the consumer experience. But once the frontend has stabilized for a few years then a product is ripe for decentralization. The v1 open version should keep the frontend constant and just change the backend. With rising nationalism amp socialism the only way to build an international tech company by 2030 may be to not build a tech company at all. Build it protocol first and share the wealth with users. Make it widely popular hard to ban open source amp algorithmically transparent. All the Uber but on the blockchain pitches from a few years ago will eventually happen. They were just too early. By protocolizing these platforms we address concerns about both state and corporate power at the same time.  The intersection is that both wow and cool types are leaders. They draw people in. But they do so in different ways. Wow is often focused on the natural world computers medicine. Cool is focused on other humans and their psychology. You might add a third category which is cozy or comfy. The drive and cover shot and kick would be cool. The food and coffee cool if done by a chef and cozy if done at home. The two concepts are actually fairly different. And while both are valued by society if you are 100 wow you probably fairly uncool and if you are 100 focused on being cool you will probably never do something wow. Wow is rocket ships limb regeneration autonomous robots GPT 3 magnetic levitation unidentified flying objects awesome in the original sense. Cool is velvet ropes fashionable clothes celebrity the pop of flash photography the craning neck the adulation of the crowd. Ah this is awesome. Hadn’t seen that looks like feature went live a few months ago. Otter does integrate with Zoom now so you can get live transcripts. No such thing as a neutral platform anymore. It’s either a neutral protocol or an opinionated platform. So lean into the opinionated part. You won’t appeal to everyone but you will appeal to some. And then expand from there. 2010s user generated content 2020s founder generated content? Gmail’s personalized smart replies is like v1 of this. A GPT 3 sequel trained on your corpus would be v2. And then? An AI standin that can give anyone at anytime a reasonable cheap answer from you at low cost. And then kick it up to the human if it’s too complex. Once a job is reduced to hitting keys and watching a screen for feedback it’s now doable in principle by a sufficiently sophisticated AI. We may all be able to continuously train our replacements. But they may be AI avatars of ourselves. You might be able to scale yourself. Remote work is recordable indexable searchable automatable work. Some meetings should be off the record of course. But it’s true that as ALL work goes on screen you can start indexing in novel ways. For example I’m surprised no one has integrated something like with Zoom. Automatic meeting minutes in a GDoc. This has a decent overview of how price signals help create decentralized order. Capitalists in the decentralized Hayekian order sense are pretty different from capitalists in the let’s make a lot of money sense. Unrequited hate when someone posts constantly about a person that never thinks about them at all. Ha. From November 2019. You’ve read that physical restaurants are over. And they may be. But virtual restaurants are about to go vertical. Investing in amazing people in Nigeria India Israel and all around the world This is pretty cool. A library of old books on technology to at least get you to 1800s 1900s levels. Why was physics the biggest thing in the early 20th century while computer science is so important today? Because we spend so much time in artificial constructed realities. But when you innovate in the physical world like with drones or sequencing you need physics again. Monopsony monopoly buyer Well I think content marketing has shown one model for free content. Arguably so has open source in the form of GitHub tutorials and coding blog posts. We’ll see but I am optimistic on paid Discord Locals Slack as a way to monetize community while leaving content free. robotic and autarkic rhyme at the end autarkic and farm rhyme in the middle Hence euphonious. Or somewhat so Status is well done from everything I can see. Been tracking it for a while. Will put it through the paces. Yes. And there’s also vote with your feet. Combinations are particularly interesting as in the concept of crowdchoice. It would be all about estimated community size x persistence x monetization capability. A different model that incentivizes educational quality evergreen content over evanescent infotainment. May be more profitable in the long run. The will of the people Let the market decide Similar concepts Different advocates Agree. And I know that’s why you have multiple CC licenses. Twitter has space constraints but in order to address issue of how does professional content get funded the community monetization model is I think going to be powerful. And incentivizes more CC content. Ah. Monetizing the community may mean charging on per user basis for access to a Discord Locals Slack or something similar. Or it could be something more sophisticated like job boards. But the idea is that free content attracts community. And monetization is then win win. The decentralized social network Get some ETH Buy an ENS address Upload a profile photo Get a profile page hosted on IPFS Now you’re on chain. stored on IPFS with IPFS URL in turn stored in an ENS custom text record your ETH pays for the IPFS pinning You could probably seed it with 100 repos using existing Creative Commons Project Gutenberg and open data sets movies audio to get some variety. Then figure out common user stories and turn into commands. Packed is bad no? Creator is canonical host of content and community moderator. People pay to access civil moderated ideologically aligned community. Yeah thinking about a toolchain similar to cargo or pip or npm but for pulling and manipulating media files rather than source code. Data analysts and people at places like ILM already do this kind of thing joint version control of text amp large binary data . Not yet everyone. It’s easy to create new git subcommands and make them behave natively. So you could progressively build up a suite of tools for pulling amp manipulating files from a set of decentralized media repos. Which may become something like pip and pypi. What would git pull look like for decentralized media? One big thing would be the use of git lfs or some equivalent for version controlling audio and video binaries. But you may also want content aware subcommands like git mp4 to extract frames. The first billion is the hardest. Imagine if you could pull any frame from any movie or any text from any article as easily as you might git pull open source software. Creative Commons Common Crawl open access in science social media Sci Hub IPFS dweb and crypto are all steps forward here. Would love to hear about your experience in more detail if you want to write a post. Well the pandemic is not a one day event like 9 11 it’s an ongoing driving force. I do think cities in other countries that have handled corona will mostly get through this. But I am bearish on US cities in general. Specifically imagine a parallel decentralized media ecosystem for movies music books news. All content would be fully open source amp free by default available in git repos for any use from memes to machine learning. Creators monetize by charging for access to the community. Creative Commons is like copyleft for content. It’s done well with 1B uses but it may still be underutilized. I’ve been thinking for some time that you might use it as the basis of a new open source media ecosystem where all content was free and you monetized the community. Yeah. We have to get to a situation where corrections are more like routine bug reports than big todos where everyone gets in a tizzy about it. If it’s the first draft of history should be treated as such Would love to see a video if you want to take one. May RT if you can include date and location when you post it. As a meta observation this is a good example of a piece of content where the ledger of record would help. You could look up timestamp uploader content hash and possibly location if we can get reliable proofs. Starts to give unambiguous who what when. This video is reported to be from the period after the unrest of early June. It would be good to see a timelapse of this amp other cities. There has been some coverage of the NYC exodus and retail apocalypse but visuals are lacking. I don’t think the city will easily bounce back. Yes crypto will be big here But pseudonymous VR boxing for charity may be a different complementary way to disincentivize casual attacks and solve the same problem of dispute resolution without bloodshed or even physical contact. Now that I think about it getting a cut of the karma breaks the illusion of social media. It makes it too obvious that it's often a game played for likes rather than a communications modality. But a cut of the crypto is always valuable. Collaboration is more natural The issue that arises is then about incentives. But a new kind of social network that allowed for collaborative accumulation of karma or crypto might solve that. Gives an incentive for allowing select? others to use your name in an anonymizing ring. Agree. The part that breaks down here is the incentive for those 99 to remain silent. But perhaps with a new social network they might get a cut of the karma or upvotes or ad revenue in return for letting their public key be used. Need to think through incentive structures. Agree. The part that breaks down here is the incentive for those 99 to remain silent. But perhaps with a new social network they might get a cut of the karma or upvotes or ad revenue in return for letting their public key be used. Need to think through incentive structures. You can do this with crypto addresses in various ways. The cleanest might be to bind a public key to an ENS name like yourname.eth and then do a lookup as follows. The crypto way of doing this is with ring signatures. Actually you might be able to implement this today if N people put their ENS domain names on their Twitter profiles as ENS has a public key lookup method. Yes. The crypto way of doing this is with ring signatures. Everyone would have their public key posted. You pick say 99 other public keys and use your private key to sign a message. All anyone knows is that it was posted by one of 100 people. This is doable right now btw. When you compare this video to the snarky coverage out there it's like night and day. For example Jake discusses cruise ships special economic zones and other at scale proof points to show feasibility. Shows the need for decentralized media. Great video by on seasteading with 130k views I do think it'll be easier to do cloud to land cities first where you build the community online crowdfund land and then migrate offline. But this is a smart summary of the ideas. The best way to test the hypothesis that tech was responsible for what went wrong in SF is a controlled experiment. Take a city built from scratch by tech in the middle of nowhere and compare it to the city of SF without tech. See which one produces immigrants. And emigrants. Here's a previous piece from 2013 which goes into more depth though there are new ideas since then . The v1 is just Facetime. The v2 would be a more immersive way of coordination. Hands free streaming on the hands side less need for verbalization from the cloud side. Action at a distance The complement to remote work will be remote hands. People you can hire to be your remote eyes ears and hands from thousands of miles away or down the street. We already do this in datacenters soon it will be everywhere. See also this thread. Tools for simulating buildings in VR prior to materializing them are currently the province of professionals. Only a matter of time before they become building blocks for new intentional social networks. A cloud community that intends to shape the land. It’s easier to start a new town than to reform San Francisco. Build a digital community of hundreds of thousands of people. Simulate the architecture in VR. Do a dry run of governance and culture online. Then crowdfund land and build it from scratch. This argument due in part to and in part to some thinking on the modern surveillance state. Counterargument We are actually in a transitional era where this is not the case. We don’t have Google Maps Streetview for spacetime. We can’t replay every event from all angles. It’s still selective due to reasonable privacy concerns. True full context would change things. Boxr like Twitter but anyone can challenge you to a VR boxing match if you insult them. Figure out fair matchups by age weight gender etc. If demographics don’t match up they fight one of your followers in their weight class and vice versa. Just insane enough to try I get it. But given that most of the folks fighting on social media will never meet in real life VR is the next best thing. The humane alternative to a duel. Actually does mean staying physically fit in order to win internet points for example. Disincentivize casual insults. Would be even better for politics. All these folks want to do is punch each other’s lights out anyway. The Canadians have actually already descended into barbarism. They can show us how it’s done. Below is their traditional protocol for leader selection. Yes this is mostly a joke but as VR headset adoption grows I’d love to see someone try this. Can you imagine some of the long running Twitter feuds turning into VR charity boxing matches? People might crowdfund the headsets. Proceeds to charity. VR boxing is getting pretty good. I do wonder if the next generation brings back online dueling. It’s the workout and the thrill of victory agony of defeat before a crowd but without the brain damage. One click Charlie Murphy I challenge you to a duel? May want multiple pseuds crypto domain names for different purposes. And you might also encrypt on chain txs such that they are only viewable by certain parties. BTC ETH allow everyone to view shielded ZEC allows no one next level may be to selectively allow someone. A major advantage of this approach is that you can view the reputation attached to your account. In the event that it’s wrong you can add a note. Or in the worst case start afresh from a new account should the old one be unfairly tarnished by some Equifax like corporate error. An Ethereum account tied to a crypto domain name is one way to solve this. For any app you type in yourname.eth amp get a login confirmation in your wallet. All metadata attached to yourname.eth is then pulled into app including reputation. A network effect around ETH accounts? In other words digitally constrained supply causes the long term price to rocket. We go to the moon not because it is easy to mine Bitcoin but because it is hard. Yes. Crypto quantifies the strength of a community. Intensity of belief of net worth in the asset multiplied by number of people over the number of years of locked coins. The concept here is that every SaaS tool gives its users some skill. So what if the internal currency of the community that all users accepted for paid tasks was also the company’s token or coin? Of course users may also take safe BTC ETH in lieu of speculative tokens. Come for the tool pay for the network? Perhaps the future of SaaS isn’t just open source but open state amp open execution. Make the tool free host it on a crypto backend and charge for coin and community. For example pay coins to the crypto Photoshop community to do tasks. VR makes the analogy between a domain name and a plot of land more than a metaphor. So does AR in reverse the digital domain adds value to the physical land. And crypto domains take this to the next level by giving a piece of digital real estate that can’t be seized. How does the cloud free the land? People form groups in the cloud and move to areas on the land where they can build freely. The sovereign collective. A domain name is like a bare plot of land. While you can build a billion dollar business at a domain name you need a billion permits to build a shed in the physical world. That pushed innovation into the cloud. But perhaps the cloud eventually frees the land. That’s because tech is about the frontier. The physical frontier closed in 1890. A centralized century followed. Then the digital frontier reopened in 1991 once NSF legalized commerce on the internet. Here’s a lecture from early 2013 on this topic In this scenario SF is first only because it’s the worst. But exodus from other cities follows as the pandemic continues for years. Prior to COVID I’d been tracking the feasibility of the autarkic robotic farm. Could people live off the land once again? Scenario the pandemic rages for years and urban exodus accelerates. The future is going solo on wide open plains. The digital frontier reopens the physical frontier. Remote work and Starlink reopens much of the map. Communes in the middle of nowhere once again become possible. Apple is sitting on piles of cash amp analytics. They can easily find amp fund the best apps in their ecosystem. It does trade off dependable App Store fees for volatile stock but a portfolio smooths it. And they’ve done large strategics before like Didi The win win move may be for Apple to take a stake in the most successful companies in the App Store in return for discounting their fees. The prospect of going from 30 to 0 would be such a lift to the stock price of these companies that it might pay Apple back immediately. Bitcoin forks don’t fork the backlinks from wallets exchanges miners block explorers and the like. That backlink structure has to be built anew for each fork which is why they aren’t dilutive in the same way that issuing more BTC would be. That said if you’re debating folks who agree the dollar is inflating away its value but are still bullish on gold I wouldn’t lead with the scarcity argument per se valid as it may be . I’d lead with the fact that physical gold has counterparty risk amp is hard to transport. Yes agree. Space constraints that’s why I wrote helped I’m not a specialist in the period but Hackett linked book argues that the flood of silver and gold was a major factor in inflation but not the trigger and not the only factor. 1 It’s true that Bitcoin is digitally scarce in a way that gold isn’t. 2 Gold from the Americas did flood Europe in the 1500s which helped cause inflation. 3 Asteroid mining sounds crazy but may produce gold in a similar way. There is a possible future in which the combination of nationalist and socialist policies by the US and other countries seriously harm the big five tech cos. and then it all goes crypto. So you can still scale internationally to billions but it has to be an open protocol. The Survivor Library is gathering essential knowledge that would be necessary to jump start modern civilization should it fail past the point where a simple 'reboot' is possible. If humanity suffers a cataclysm nuclear war runaway global warming or any of a number of other potential catastrophes a lot of scientific knowledge could be lost especially the practical ‘how to’ kind. If I left you in the woods with a hatchet how long before you could send me an email? Think of this as a visual companion to 's book The Knowledge. You probably couldn't do this in the city but lots of people have recently moved out to the countryside so This I want to see. A small group should do this for real and film instructional videos along the way. 0 to civilization in how many hours? Btw that dex article was by . I always keep my eye out for folks writing strong informative numerically grounded work. His recent body of work is a good overview of defi if you want to get up to speed. After years of development dexes are finally starting to move real volume. Looks like they're collectively at 10 of Binance in 24 hours 420M vs 4B . The full selection of tokens coins isn't there yet but it should hopefully get there over time. Where we're going we won't need centralization. PSA I am always available to help you with your studies and career if you’re a young engineer well so much as time and ability permit but I do think it’s our responsibility to help the next generation Every name becomes a domain name Or at least a URL In a sense this is just a reboot of the original RDF vision where every resource had a URI. But crypto domain names allow the necessary innovation at DNS level to revisit many of these ideas. Blockusign You can literally sign a contract using crypto domain names. The date typed out name and signature field would be replaced by the timestamp typed out crypto domain name and on chain digital signatures of each party. ENS has custom record types. So you could define an ERC20 record just like a TXT or CNAME and put the corresponding contract address there. Maybe or has other ideas though. If crypto is programmable money crypto domain names are programmable names. A decentralized alternative to fiat money a decentralized alternative to fiat names. Yeah. And all that is great But it has to work natively without a plugin or slash or else you type it in and get a confusing 404. I know Opera is already there. Means a working with browsers to add support and b maybe showing a demo social network that uses these features. Yeah that’s interesting. Maybe crypto domain reputation is part of how people make crypto ISAs amp personal tokens work. As well as other forms of verification is this a bot spam account? Also allows people to start from scratch with a new name. Yeah. It’s interesting because it also hacks the highly visible name field as a form of export. Key to making this work is resolving crypto domain names in Chrome or some workaround for this . And they’re programmable names you don’t need white pages people search engines or other lookup tables as much because the contact info and name are the same you can transfer karma between crypto domains held in the same HD wallet see below Using crypto domain names in place of real names has more advantages you can attach metadata in the form of TXT records you can send receive encrypted data directly to the name not just messages you can verify identity via domain metadata signing and or staking It solves like 10 different problems. For example name squatting goes away. You would now need to validate DNS or ENS etc to get your username on each service. But then you reliably get the same brand everywhere rather than having on one service and on another. If we use crypto domains in place of real names usernames everywhere that obviates questions like what’s your username email or how do I pay you . Because it’s now obvious. Same unique username on every service. Send an encrypted message or payment to that domain. Yes exactly. I knew all this but the switch flipped for me the other day when I combined this with my pseudonymous economy talk. What you want from someone on the internet is JUST their domain name. Not their their real name which is their state name or social security name. If you get someone’s crypto domain name you can find them on the internet pay them and send them an encrypted message while knowing only what they choose to share. Globally unique amp useful while also being totally pseudonymous. To say the least state names can’t do this. Imagine a social network which only allowed you to sign up with a valid crypto domain name. Now imagine you didn’t need to sign up at all. Just flip a switch to make your data accessible so the service can read amp write to a subset of your domain. Like . With decentralized DNS like and more it starts to get interesting to think about domain names as being the default for decentralized media. A crypto domain collapses names usernames discovery payment profiles amp encryption into one thing. If you read Seeing Like a State there’s a sense in which the term real name is a misnomer. A better term is a state name a name which makes you legible to the state. By analogy a domain name is a network name. A name which makes you legible to the network. Domain name gt real name A domain name may be the most useful type of pseudonym. It pulls up your site as the first hit when punched into a browser indeed it bypasses search altogether. It’s also globally unique programmable persistent and cross culturally understood. Personally though I am partial to crypto civilization. Real crypto anarchy has never been tried. You might think that California running out of money a few months into a multiyear pandemic signals doom. That the state might not be able to pay its bills that it’s a touch and go situation. But my friend you underestimate the American spirit We have not yet begun to print. Never back down from a necessary fight but always think about how to make the fight unnecessary. Fun roundup of some of the ideas I’ve put out there. Always interesting to see how tweets ricochet around the world. Though I should put it down in long form as otherwise some of it gets lost in translation. Examples Address climate with fusion Stop surveillance with encryption Reduce traffic with micromobility Control COVID with testing This is the technological progressive worldview. Social problems exist amp we should go after them. Start with what you can do as an individual. Good conversation on ideas for realigning tech media and the broader society. I do believe part of the long run solution is making media millionaires. If you create content that inspires people to solve social problems with technology fund your followers amp get a fair share. Also a good one. Like reproducible research. Good one. Kind of like zero knowledge. You might call this meta knowledge proofs. to that data is routed through a server you control. This doesn’t solve the problem of caching decrypted content though. But that may be tolerable if after deletion update it can no longer be cryptographically proved that said decrypted content came from the author. The next question is how to get host nodes in the network to enforce a decentralized update delete. How do you make it such that data was readable by some and now it’s not? Maybe something like forward secrecy or Kerberos tickets can be used here. Or perhaps all read access There are different models. There's the current create read only of blockchains and IPFS. Or the server can do anything model of most cloud services. But there may be an intermediate where only a user with their own private key can update delete their own records. One thing such a bridge would instantly make clear is that your budget for college doesn't budget for maintenance. How do you know your skills aren't out of date? People like have been working on this problem amp have some amazing results. The fiat currency to cryptocurrency bridge was more important than many expected. And still has a lot of legs. I think other fiat to crypto bridges may also be a big deal over time. Like the fiat identity to cryptoidentity bridge. Portable cross platform attestation of skills? I think pseudonymity actually helps rebuild trust as it prevents both discrimination and cancellation. Long form version in talk below. The next step after remote work is pseudonymous work. Once all work can be done through an internet connection people don't need to know your official name. And Square and are pioneers here once again. Yes they're the closest. But are more like infotainment than edutainment. Do you typically have a new skill at the end of a documentary? Maybe you know a bit more about a historical period. But still you're not sure whether they had scrupulous adherence to the facts. He's basically saying the same thing as you. He's saying that individuals are easier to diligence than opaque institutions. Now that I see all the news that isn’t fit to print I wonder Why’d you leave that out? Why’d you choose that headline? What else is being censored? I don’t trust the masthead. I don’t even trust the journalists…I seek out subjects directly on Twitter. Yeah. But Netflix is too focused on eating up time. I think it'd have to be a new platform like with an incentive for learning something quickly amp well. Edutainment gt infotainment in terms of both short term cost requires focus amp long term benefit builds skill Exams show this is at least somewhat doable for a wide class of skills. Peer review as per LinkedIn Skills would expand scope further. Satoshi's huge innovation was solving the problem of consensus in an adversarial environment. It's insanely broad in its applicability as it can be applied beyond BTC to figure out who did what when for every transaction and every assertion. The blockchain as digital history. This is related to other consensus algorithms and the general concept of convergence in math. How many timesteps before consensus? How many terms in a series before convergence? And will we achieve consensus convergence all? There's a tradeoff between truth and time Yes. Satoshi quantified this in the Bitcoin whitepaper through the concept of the number of independent confirmations. How much time to wait before we can reliably estimate the true state of the blockchain? Side note Google appears to have rolled out a modification to search. They use direct links to text fragments which modify the URL amp are highlighted on the page in yellow as above. There's a Chrome extension for this though it appears built in to search. I've thought about this for a while in the context of doing more with placement testing. You can self administer a placement test on a topic say convex optimization to see what details are still in working memory. And see where to brush up. DRAM refresh for the brain? Proof of memory Brilliant concept by the inimitable . His metric would show how many downloads of an idea into people's brains had actually occurred. It's like a way to track active installs for ideas. That's super cool. In some cases N proofs of memory can be aggregated into a single proof of skill. Like a recent score on a history exam demonstrates working knowledge of a particular time period. Twitter has space constraints but a digital signature does show that either 1 someone got your private key to sign the message 2 someone managed to break the cryptographic scheme 3 someone guessed the correct signature by luck The last is vanishingly improbable. Yeah you could do that with an NFT signed by say Lambda School or where they assert that you had a particular skill at a particular time in their assessment. cc A thread on the ledger of record for context. Worth compiling a list of proof of Xs. For example proof of who digital signature proof of what cryptographic hash proof of when blockchain timestamp There's also proof of location proof of space etc. Each such proof expands the scope of the ledger of record. Got more? Well I think we'll find that without digital history without a cryptographically verified record of who asserted what when that society falls apart completely. an assertion is not itself a fact but crypto does allow probabilistic truth for the metadata who what when Well BTC works because its timestamps aren't falsifiable. And totalitarian regimes have always been interested in falsifying history. A blockchain is already a digital history of who did what when. And with proof of location identity etc we may be able to expand scope. Great thread on how many fans appreciated more in depth educational commentary on sports. Learning while being entertained. This is related to something else I've often thought about. Every genre of movie exists in Hollywood comedy drama horror other than education. gt Is it really such an issue to trust a centralized provider for the timestamp Yes. The precise timeline of what happened when is often exactly what's in dispute. Here's a thread with 3 examples of timestamps resolving issues Tesla Brazil China . I get where you're coming from but here's what I think the progression of ideas is. v1 we care about truth v2 it's all tribal infotainment no one cares v3 actually financial and technological decision makers really do care about truth A step towards this is Axios' bullet point summaries. But cryptography provides a level up in trust. Argument from cryptography gt argument from authority. Basically move from tweets to cryptographically signed on chain assertions. A for the record button. For example the recent hack wouldn't have been possible if Twitter used digital signatures. Bezos would keep a file on his laptop that he used to sign his posts. An attacker would then have to compromise that file to post as him. You cryptographically verify every post. Yes the core issue is that popularity isn't truth. And 's ideas are good. But I think the next system must use cryptography. who via digital signature what via hash when via timestamp That's how we establish unambiguous truth in an adversarial environment. It also truly is a full stack problem. You can't fund media today without thinking about how social media sets and distorts everyone's incentives. Crypto amp NLP do offer us a number of new tools however and that's where a lot of thought is going. Some examples Kristof's article inspiring Gates to go after public health Minority Report sparking Kinect and other tech and Ready Player One inspiring Oculus. Inspiring journalists filmmakers and authors could be integrated into the financing pipeline to receive a share. We also need mechanisms to realign tech media and society. One concept is if your article or film inspires someone to found a great company that solves a social problem eg fusion energy to address climate as media creator you get a piece of the investment in cash amp equity. Yang's right. Btw tech really does want to fund media amp is thinking deeply about it. But we need better incentives for both media AND social media. Otherwise we'll get no handshakes pieces followed by no retractions. Due to social media that maximizes popularity over truth. Btw it might be interesting to do a polite written debate sometime. I do believe the universalist version of Western values Bitcoin Mars etc should win in the long term. But I think we need to take China seriously as a peer competitor while avoiding war. I have nothing against Zeihan and think some of his work on natural resources is interesting. However his 2010 prediction of China collapse by 2020 didn't come to pass and I generally think his worldview overweights geography amp underweights technology. That's an interesting counterargument. Essentially that the damage has already been done. Here's a counter to that counter many organizations and businesses that might have survived a few months can't survive a much longer period and are giving up. That'd be the moment when people claim China is actually ahead. From there many possible branches. 1 Ignore. GDP doesn't matter. 2 Accept defeat. The West lost and or should have lost. 3 Reboot perhaps as per . 4 Something else? Here's the thing. 1 If both these trends continue for another year where the US drops 30 40 and China muddles through 2 And if you believe these numbers Then China may overtake the US in GDP by mid 2021. Conversely China reports that its GDP rebounded in Q2. Of course they may well have massaged the numbers. However it does appear they have been hit less hard by COVID 19 if we triangulate from reports on the ground. The actual drop in GDP relative to Q2 last year was 9.5 not 32.9 . However if the impact of COVID 19 continues for another year we might actually see something like a true 30 40 drop in GDP. One possible UX would be like Google Analytics' AI query bar shown below. Use natural language queries to pull info from across your company. You might need to do a v2 of GPT 3 with the capacity to link the input data that led it to a particular suggestion. By restricting to internally public strings we obviate privacy issues for v1. It's a global AI. A v2 might give personalized AI avatars for each employee. If employee A has access to read employee B's writing they can ask B's AI avatar a question. May be useful if B is asleep. GPT 3 Corporate AI when? Replace your knowledge base with a godlike AI that has indexed every internally public string ever written by someone at your company. Pulls in Slack Docs Github… Btw somewhat relatedly this is a cool thread on crawling the IPFS. It's not structured like a typical blockchain where you can start at the genesis block and just download the whole thing. Instead you have to traverse the IPFS distributed hash table. Already happening Another way of thinking about blockchains is that they're open state databases. Anyone can read or write. As such they provide a vision for how one might open up the backend of Facebook or Twitter in a privacy respecting data integrity preserving way. At least in theory Also true that it's quite bandwidth intensive to do a big crawl of the internet so that's a deterrent as well. I've been thinking more about how important open state databases like Common Crawl are. It was an input to GPT 3. What else can we do with it? Chain crawling is easier than web crawling. Websites have robots.txt files that prevent the hoi polloi from indexing them. But public blockchains have no such thing. Every user is a root user because these are open state databases. Yeah though it depends on how hard the aggregation is. Chain crawling is somewhat easier than web crawling. Blockchains don't have an equivalent of robots.txt. There is no way to prevent a random user from indexing a chain. So a Common Crawl for crypto would be less useful. gt which said that truth no longer matters in journalism Here's my argument how many retractions corrections and apologies have we seen for the early COVID 19 coverage? First she was a producer for seven years amp said this happens at all commercial networks. Second here's CJR Nick Kristof and Jill Abramson saying same thing the quest for clicks distorts coverage. The problem is real. It's due to social media too of course. Mike these are large multinational corporations that offer a product like any other. Just like we could critique BlackBerry Barnes amp Noble and Blockbuster I'd hope we can criticize Comcast the 197B parent corp in question. These entities have power yes? First when media corps critique other groups a single individual is often profiled as representative. Agree? Second she's by no means the only person to raise these points either inside or outside. Worth listening to the critique. Remember a few months ago when we predicted smart masks due to the high stakes and massive daily use? It's happening. 2 independent confirmations of content  Well all blockchain users are equal to root users in that sense as well as none of them have the unilateral ability to delete data change schema shut down the DB or change params like the 21 million BTC limit. Every user is equal. All can read amp write no one can delete. Did you read it? You can put a relational layer on top of a blockchain which every exchange does. That's not the key distinction. The key is that anyone in the world gets full read access . And write access given crypto or compute . That's not true for say Twitter's DB. By the way I have probably 100 essays sitting on the web or in draft that I want to collect at the site. This piece is a republication with some edits of an article from May 2019. This one is for all the non crypto engineers. Are you using AWS Google Cloud or Azure? And have you wondered what value a blockchain adds over a traditional DB? The short answer is public blockchains accommodate millions of simultaneous root users. Aren't blockchains just databases? Yes but a special kind. Public blockchains are massively multiclient databases where every user is a root user. v1 facts are important v2 facts don't matter only tribal narratives do v3 actually facts really do matter especially for financial and technological decision makers See some examples in this thread where facts resolved recent disputes. Part of that better way may be the ledger of record. Mathematically provable facts that people can agree on regardless of ideology. But another part may be aligning media creators with the health amp wealth of the people they inform. Skin in the game. Read it all. Here are four of the most notable passages on the corporate distortion of truth. Please note this is not partisan. It happens at all for profit media outlets and is amplified by social media engagement algorithms. We need a better way. This resignation letter by Ariana Pekary from MSNBC is worth reading in full. It documents the complete breakdown of our information supply chain due to bad incentives. For media corporations truth no longer matters. Only popularity does in the form of ratings and clicks. Social networks can actually help with this a lot. Put your work and portfolio online and you can connect with people in an organic way outside of the formal environment of a job fair. Also access to a professional network has been opened up in a way it never was before. Tools like GitHub Twitter etc allow you to find people in your field and talk to them. I don't even think college alumni networks are that valuable anymore. Would be interesting to measure. I say this in all honesty absolutely not. Stanford isn't what it was academia isn't what it was. I wish I had the internet then so I could have started my life earlier. Getting all those degrees may have been a reasonable decision many years ago but it's not optimal anymore. No. The people who can point a gun at you have power. They can literally jail you for not sending your kid to school. This is an antiquated system that needs to be replaced. This is part of the difference between the East Coast vs tech mentality. Much of the East Coast is about inherited wealth nepotism old institutions groupthink hypocrisy. They project that onto tech. But tech actually believes what they are saying. I applaud you for asking about skin in the game But there's a key point here. Technological progressives really do use the things they say they use. Whereas technological conservatives say they like public school then send their kids to private school. Sincerity vs hypocrisy. Good insight. It may be the case that you have a relatively small number of star teachers who create engaging digital textbooks maybe aided by AI to give personalized attention to each student . And an in person facilitator who is focused on childcare. Division of labor. Just like desktop software development made sense 20 30 years ago college may have made sense for the last generation. It doesn't anymore. The price performance isn't there. And you don't need it for a good job. They are real and already being adopted. Why send your kids to college? To go into debt for Zoom classes? Do a serious open source project build a large Substack or create a strong portfolio. Then apply for a job or start a company. That's much more impressive than a degree. There's already good energy around college replacement Coursera Udacity Udemy Lambda School YC and then specialist sites like and Binance Academy. But K 12 is different as you have a physical childcare component that is missing from adult education.</td>\n",
